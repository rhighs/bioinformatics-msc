Passive transport : movement of substances down their concentration gradient (e.g., ion channels seen in Genetica Dei Ricordi - Andrea Levi ). Active transport : Pumping substances against their gradient using energy (e.g., sodium-potassium pump). This includes transportation of large molecules (e.g. glucose and glucose transporters) Ion transport : Regulatinon of Ion flow to maintain electrical and chemical balance (e.g., calcium or chloride channels). Receptor proteins Proteins that are responsible for cellular communications by detecting chemical signals from the extracellular environment. Essential for processes like immune response, cell growth, metabolism, and sensory perception. Membrane enzymes Among these useful things, here are some of the most important Signal transduction : Membrane enzymes help relay signals from the outside to the inside Metabolism : Some membrane enzymes participate in metabolic pathwways (e.g. ATP synthase in the mitochondrial membrane is responsible for producing ATP) Transport regulation : Edit substances to facilitate their transport across the cell membrane. For instance, some enzymes modify molecules like glucose, making them easier to transport. Cytoplasm Internal volume enclosed by the plasma membrane Composed of cytosol Higly concentrated solution, it is the fluid portion of the cytoplasm It is a gel-like substance that contains water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and proteins. The cytosol serves as the site for many cellular processes, such as: Metabolic reactions Signal transduction And the transport of materials. The cytosol generally provides a medium in which organelles are suspended and facilitates the movement of molecules and ions throughout the cell. It's an isolated enviroment where all sort of cellular processes take place Among other things, the cytosol contains enzymes, RNA, amino acids, nucleotides, metabolites, coenzymes, and inorganic ions Nucleus and the Genome What is the Genome? A genome is the complete set of genetic material in an organism, including all of its DNA It contains all the instructions needed for growth, development, functioning, and reproduction. The genome includes not only genes, which code for proteins, but also non-coding regions that regulate gene expression and maintain structural integrity. What type of information does the various genome components encode? A summarization of what I understood by reading \"The Self-Assembling Brain\" : The genome is better understood not just as a descriptive set of instructions, but as an algorithmic system\u2014one that operates dynamically to produce complex biological outcomes. Rather than merely listing the static information of genes, the genome functions as an active program that interacts with the environment, executes processes, and adapts its output based on various conditions. In prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), the genome is typically stored as a single, circular DNA molecule located in the nucleoid, an area of the cell without a membrane. In eukaryotes , the genome is organized into multiple linear DNA molecules, stored within a membrane-bound nucleus, with additional genetic material present in organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts. Supramolecular structures Cells build supramolecular structures which are are large assemblies of molecules held together by noncovalent interactions, including hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, van der Waals forces, and the hydrophobic effect. These structures are important because they are flexible and can form or break easily. Examples include: Protein complexes : Groups of proteins working together. Lipid bilayers : The main structure of cell membranes. DNA double helix : Two strands of DNA held by hydrogen bonds. Cell assemblies : Structures like ribosomes and chromatin in cells. The main elements comprising biomolecules The main elements in biochemical materials are carbon (C) , hydrogen (H) , oxygen (O) , and nitrogen (N) . These elements strongly tend to form covalent bonds, leading to a wide variety of chemical and biological compounds. 70% of the human body is made up of water (H\u2082O). Sulfur (S) is found in nearly all proteins. Phosphorus (P) is crucial for metabolism and the structure of nucleic acids like DNA and RNA. Functional groups Functional groups are specific groups of atoms within molecules that determine the characteristic chemical reactions and properties of those molecules. In biomolecules, functional groups are essential for dictating how molecules interact with each other and perform biological functions These groups typically replace hydrogen atoms in hydrocarbons, giving rise to molecules with diverse chemical behaviors. Variety of carbon ( \\(\\text{C}\\) ): Carbon's ability to form covalent single, double, and occasionally triple bonds makes it incredibly versatile. In biological molecules, this means carbon can create stable, complex structures essential for life, such as chains and rings, which serve as backbones for biomolecules. Formation of 4 stable single bonds : Carbon can form up to four stable single covalent bonds with other atoms, including other carbon atoms. This property allows the formation of long carbon chains and branched structures, which are foundational to many biomolecules like carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Biomolecules as hydrocarbons: Biomolecules can be thought of as hydrocarbons (compounds made of hydrogen and carbon). In most biomolecules, some of the hydrogen atoms are replaced by functional groups, such as: hydroxyl \\(\\text{-OH}\\) carboxyl \\(\\text{-COOH}\\) amino \\(\\text{-NH}_2\\) Giving the molecules distinct properties and reactivity. The four classes of biomolecules Nucleic Acids : DNA and RNA, which store and transmit genetic information. Lipids : Fats and oils used for energy storage, insulation, and cell membranes. Carbohydrates : Sugars and starches used for energy and structure. Proteins : Made of amino acids; they act as enzymes, structural components, and in cell signaling. Macromolecules are the major constituents of a cell \\(\\rightarrow\\) these structures are polymers with molecular weight that go beyond \\(\\text{5000 Da } \\text{(daltons } \\leftrightarrow \\text{g/mol)}\\) . They are assembled from relatively simple precursors: Precursors refer to simpler molecules or building blocks that combine to form larger, more complex structures. Macromolecules like proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides are constructed from these foundational precursors, linking together through chemical bonds to create the intricate structures necessary for cellular function. Proteins are large polymers made of amino acids, connected in specific sequences by peptide bonds. Their structure determines their roles, including catalyzing reactions, providing structural support, signaling, and transporting molecules within cells. The sequence of amino acids carries information that dictates the protein\u2019s shape and function. Nucleic Acids include DNA and RNA, which are polymers of nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a nitrogenous base, a sugar, and a phosphate group. DNA stores genetic information, while RNA transmits this information for protein synthesis. The sequence of bases in nucleic acids encodes genetic instructions crucial for cellular processes. Polysaccharides are long chains of simple sugars, such as glucose, and function in energy storage (like glycogen in animals and starch in plants) or provide structural support (like cellulose in plants). Though not all are informational, specific short polysaccharides (oligosaccharides) on cell surfaces help in cell recognition and signaling. Oligomers are short chains of monomers, typically fewer than ten subunits. These can act as intermediates in forming larger macromolecules or function independently, especially in cellular signaling or molecular assembly. Informational Macromolecules The term \u201cinformational macromolecules\u201d highlights that proteins, nucleic acids, and some oligosaccharides possess sequences that convey specific information. This sequence-dependent information is crucial for encoding biological functions, as seen in DNA\u2019s genetic code, RNA\u2019s message translation, and protein amino acid sequences that specify structure and function. This structured information enables the precise regulation of cellular activities and organismal development. Nucleic acids Nucleic acids are molecules essential for storing, transmitting, and processing genetic information in cells. What is a gene? A gene is a segment of a DNA molecule that contains the necessary information for synthesizing a functional biological product, either a protein or RNA. Basic functions of DNA : Storage of biological information. Transmission of that information to subsequent generations. Nucleotides Nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). They consist of three main components: A nitrogenous base, which can be either a pyrimidine (cytosine, thymine, or uracil) or a purine (adenine or guanine). A pentose sugar, either ribose (in RNA) or deoxyribose (in DNA). One or more phosphate groups. If a nucleotide lacks a phosphate group, it is called a nucleoside . Differences between DNA and RNA RNA is ribonucleic acid, which contains the pentose sugar ribose. DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid, containing deoxyribose, which lacks one oxygen atom compared to ribose. Some of the key differences can be highlighted below as both functional and structural traits: Sugar : DNA contains deoxyribose, while RNA contains ribose. Nitrogenous Bases : DNA includes adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine; RNA has uracil instead of thymine. Structure : DNA is usually double-stranded, forming a double helix, whereas RNA is typically single-stranded. Function : DNA primarily stores genetic information, while RNA has multiple roles, including protein synthesis (mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA) and regulatory functions. Nucleotides can also function as monomers What even is a monomer? A monomer is a small molecule that can join with other similar or identical molecules to form a polymer . Nucleotides serve as monomers for nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and play crucial roles beyond building DNA and RNA strands. Functions of Nucleotides Beyond DNA and RNA Synthesis Energy Currency : ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a nucleotide that serves as a primary energy carrier in cells. It captures chemical energy from food breakdown and releases it to fuel various cellular processes. Enzyme Cofactors : Nucleotides form parts of enzyme cofactors, such as NAD\u207a (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide). These cofactors assist in redox reactions critical for cellular respiration and energy production. Signaling Molecules : cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a signaling molecule derived from ATP. It helps in transmitting signals within cells, such as those triggered by hormones, allowing cells to respond appropriately to external stimuli. Cellular Metabolism and Signal Transduction Nucleotides are integral to cellular metabolism as they contribute to energy transfer, signal transmission, and the regulation of metabolic pathways. For example, cAMP acts as a \"second messenger\" in many signal transduction pathways, relaying messages from hormones outside the cell to elicit responses within the cell, such as enzyme activation or gene expression adjustments. Phosphodiester Bonds Link Successive Nucleotides in Nucleic Acids A phosphodiester linkage is covalent bond that joins successive nucleotides of both DNA and RNA . The linkage happens between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the hydroxyl group of another neighbor nucleotide. Base pairing permits the duplication of genetic information A base pair is a label given to the hydrogen-bonding patterns that emerge between complementary strands of nucleic acids. Each nucleotide in DNA pairs specifically with only one other nucleotide: adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T) \\(\\rightarrow \\text{A-T T-A}\\) , and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G) \\(\\rightarrow \\text{G-C C-G}\\) . This specific pairing means that the strand on the opposite side of each base pair serves as a template that complements and mirrors the sequence of the current strand, creating a complementary strand (e.g., one strand determines the sequence of the other). DNA is a double helix that stores genetic information Offset pairing of the two strands creates a major groove and a minor groove In the DNA double helix, hydrogen bonding and base structure determine the pairing strength between the bases: Base Pairing Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T) , forming 2 hydrogen bonds . Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C) , forming 3 hydrogen bonds . Reason for Bonding Differences G-C pairs are stronger due to the third hydrogen bond, making these pairs more stable and contributing to the DNA's structural integrity, especially in high-GC regions. A-T pairs are slightly weaker because they have only two hydrogen bonds, which is sufficient for stable pairing but results in a slightly lower melting temperature in A-T-rich regions. Groove Formation The offset pairing of the DNA strands creates the major and minor grooves . These grooves are essential as they allow protein interactions, enabling DNA replication, transcription, and other cellular processes. the groove structure allows DNA to make some information highly accessible (major groove) for regulatory purposes, while other interactions are more generalized or protective (minor groove). This arrangement is crucial for efficient cellular function and precise control over genetic processes. Secondary structure of RNA In the secondary structure of RNA, the overall shape and stability arise from A-form double helix regions and loops or bulges due to mismatches or unpaired bases. Bulges and Internal Loops : Bulges occur when there are extra, unpaired bases on one strand, causing a bump in the structure. Internal Loops form between unpaired bases on both strands, often in palindromic sequences where the RNA folds back on itself, creating gaps or \"loops.\" Functional Role : These irregularities (bulges and loops) are crucial for RNA's interactions and functions, exposing bases for binding with proteins, other RNAs, or small molecules, enabling RNA's diverse cellular roles. In essence, these \"zipped and unzipped\" sections give RNA flexibility and unique functional sites. What does RNA do? There are some different classes of RNA ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) \\(\\rightarrow\\) components of ribosomes. messenger RNAs (mRNAs) \\(\\rightarrow\\) intermediates in protein synthesis transfer RNAs (tRNAs) \\(\\rightarrow\\) adapter molecules that translate the information in mRNA into a specific amino acid sequence literally the type of RNA that puts the mRNA into practice noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) \\(\\rightarrow\\) wide variety of functions. most of these are found involved in translation processes translation is the the process in a living organism by which proteins are produced via RNA. \ud83d\udd17 Resources yourgenome: from DNA to Protein: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles called ribosomes are the 'factories' where translation takes place in the cell. $\\alpha\\text{-amino acids} $ are the amino acids in which amino and carboxyl groups are bound to the same carbon atom Types of protein structures Each level of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary) contributes to the overall shape and function of the protein. Primary structure The first structure defines the unique order in which amino acids are linked together to form a protein. Proteins are constructed from a set of 20 amino acids that are represented in the image above. Structure for amino acids is generally like follows: A carbon, the \\(\\alpha\\) carbon bonded to the four groups: A \\(\\ce{H}\\) atom A Carboxyl group \\(\\ce{-COOH}\\) An amino group \\(\\ce{NH2}\\) A \"variable\" group or \"R\" group, that could really be anything The \"R\" group varies among amino acids and determines the differences between these protein monomers. NOTE : The order of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is unique and specific to a particular protein. Altering a single amino acid causes a gene mutation, which most often results in a non-functioning protein. Secondary structure Secondary structure refers to the coiling or folding of a polypeptide chain that gives the protein its 3D shape. \\(\\alpha \\space helix \\rightarrow\\) coiled spring and is secured by hydrogen bonding \\(\\beta \\space pleated \\space sheet\\rightarrow\\) held together by hydrogen bonding between polypeptide units of the folded chain that lie adjacent to one another. Tertiary structure This structure refers to the comprehensive 3D structure of the polypeptide chain of a protein. There are several bonds and forces holding a protein together Hydrophobic interactions , probably the most relevant. The \"R\" group of the amino acid is either hydrophobic or hydrophilic. Hydrophilic \"R\" groups will seek contact with their aqueous environment, while hydrophobic \"R\" groups will avoid water and position towards the center. Hydrogen bonding as reinforcement of the structure given by the latter. Due to protein folding , ionic bonding can occur between the oppositely charged \"R\" groups that could form further bonds. Folding can also result in covalent bonding between the \"R\" groups of cysteine amino acids. This type of bonding forms what is called a disulfide bridge ... van der Waals forces also assist in the stabilization of protein structure. Quaternary Structure Quaternary Structure refers to the structure of a protein macromolecule formed by interactions between multiple polypeptide chains (forming dimers, trimers, tetramers, etc.) Each polypeptide chain is referred to as a subunit. Proteins with quaternary structure may consist of more than one of the same type of protein subunit. Such proteins can be dynamic, allowing conformational changes essential for function. Allows complex formations like ion channels and receptors. Facilitates regulation via allosteric effects, where binding at one site affects another. Example : Hemoglobin : found in the blood, is an iron-containing protein that binds oxygen molecules. It contains four subunits: two alpha subunits and two beta subunits. Hemoglobin shows cooperative behavior, where oxygen binding to one subunit affects others. Lipids These are not considered polymeers as they are not build from smaller subunits similar in composition/structure. As such, they have highly variable chemical structure, poor solubility in water. Used as energy stored and they're the structural foundation of membranes. NOTE : lipids are classified according to their level of complexity: simple, complex and derivative Fatty acids Fatty acids are water-insoluble hydrocarbons user for cellular energy storage. How come they store energy? Fatty acids have a high energy density because their long hydrocarbon chains contain numerous \\(\\ce{C-H}\\) (carbon-hydrogen) bonds. These bonds are rich in energy because they are non-polar and relatively weak, making them easily broken down to release energy. When oxidized during metabolism, these bonds release a significant amount of energy, more than carbohydrates and proteins per gram. Fatty acids can either be: Saturated All carbons along the chain have the maximum amount of \\(\\ce{H}\\) atoms bonded to them, leading to no \\(\\ce{C=C}\\) double bonds. Insaturated \\(\\ce{C=C}\\) double bonds are present Packing is the feature of fatty acids that allow them to \"pack\" together into increasingly steady structural form depending on the degree of the unsaturation. Fully saturated fats \\(\\rightarrow\\) quasi perfect packing \\(\\Rightarrow\\) waxy at room temp. Increasingly insaturated fats \\(\\rightarrow\\) more messy packing \\(\\Rightarrow\\) liquid tendency at room temp. Glycerophospholipids The main component of membranes in bacteria, plants and animals. glycerophospholipids (aka phosphoglycerides) are membrane lipids in which two fatty acids are attached in ester linkage to the first and seconds carbons of glycerol, and a highly polar or charged group is attached through a phosphodiester linkage to the third carbon. Glycerol shown in red. Carbons numbering in glycerol goes left to right. Blue represent the group bonded to the glycerol via the phosphodiester linkage . Micelle formations Spherical structures containing amphipathic molecules arranged with hydrophobic regions in the interior and hydrophilic head groups on the exterior. This formation is favoured when the cross sectional are of the head group is greater than that of the acyl side chain(s), leading to a sort of code shape if you will. The hydrophobic effect What does it lead to in lipids? The hydrophobic effect drives glycerophospholipids to form bilayers in water, where hydrophobic tails minimize contact with water by clustering inward while hydrophilic heads face outward. This self-organization creates an enclosed membrane structure (formed as a bilayer, where tails can be seen aggregating in the middle of the two head layers), essential for forming cellular compartments, facilitating communication, and regulating substance movement in and out of the cell. The bilayer formation is favoured in cases where the cross-sectional area of the head group is similar to the one of the acyl side chains. Proteins are interspersed within this lipid bilayer, either embedded within the membrane ( integral proteins ) or attached to its surface ( peripheral proteins ). These proteins can move laterally within the membrane, contributing to its fluidity and functionality. The overall pattern results in a dynamic and flexible structure that supports various cellular functions, such as transport, signaling, and communication. Triacylglycerols, storage of energy and insulation Triacyglycerols are the simplest lipids constructed from fatty acids - They are composed of three fatty acids, each in ester linkage with a single glycerol (esters of glycerol) REMIND - An ester linkage is a bond formed between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid, resulting in the release of water (a condensation reaction). In this bond, the hydroxyl group \\(\\ce{-OH}\\) of the carboxylic acid reacts with the hydroxyl group of the alcohol, leading to the formation of an ester functional group \\(\\ce{-COO-}\\) . In the context of lipids, ester linkages are significant because they link fatty acids to glycerol in triglycerides and glycerophospholipids. - An alcohol is an organic compound that contains one or more hydroxyl groups \\(\\ce{-OH}\\) attached to a carbon atom. Quick overview on carbs Carbohydrates are organic compounds made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, typically in a 1:2:1 ratio. They are classified into three categories: Monosaccharides : Simple sugars like glucose and fructose, which serve as energy sources. Disaccharides : Composed of two monosaccharides, such as sucrose (table sugar) and lactose (milk sugar). Polysaccharides : Long chains of monosaccharides, including starch (energy storage in plants) and cellulose (structural support in plant cell walls). Carbohydrates are the most abundant biomolecules on Earth, crucial for energy storage and metabolism, and are produced in plants via photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide and water are converted into sugars using sunlight.","title":"Lesson 1 - An Introduction to Cell Biology: Key Concepts and Biomolecules"},{"location":"lectures/biochemistry/lesson-1.html#lesson-1-an-introduction-to-cell-biology-key-concepts-and-biomolecules","text":"Lesson 1 - An Introduction to Cell Biology: Key Concepts and Biomolecules The Living Cell Plasma Membrane Cytoplasm Nucleus and the Genome Supramolecular structures The main elements comprising biomolecules Functional groups The four classes of biomolecules Informational Macromolecules Nucleic acids Differences between DNA and RNA Nucleotides can also function as monomers Functions of Nucleotides Beyond DNA and RNA Synthesis Cellular Metabolism and Signal Transduction Phosphodiester Bonds Link Successive Nucleotides in Nucleic Acids Base pairing permits the duplication of genetic information DNA is a double helix that stores genetic information Secondary structure of RNA What does RNA do?

Rather than merely listing the static information of genes, the genome functions as an active program that interacts with the environment, executes processes, and adapts its output based on various conditions. In prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), the genome is typically stored as a single, circular DNA molecule located in the nucleoid, an area of the cell without a membrane.

The definition of bioinformatics is not universally agreed upon , however we'll define it as... \"The creation and development of advanced information and computational technologies for problems in biology, most commonly molecular biology\" In alternative, the following extended defition could be considered: Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that combines biology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics to analyze and interpret biological data, especially large datasets. It primarily involves developing algorithms, computational models, and software tools to understand biological processes and systems. Definition of Computational Biology (according to the \\(\\text{NIH}\\) ) Computational Biology refers to the development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation tecniques to the study of biological, behavioral and, social systems. What is Systems Biology? It is the study of the interactions between components of a biological systems, and how these interactions give rise to the funciton and behavior of that system. To create models that describe all the interactions within a biological system, such as interactions between genes, proteins, or metabolic pathways. The goal is not just to study individual components, but to understand how they work together as a whole to drive the behavior and function of the system. Since the aim is to model all interactions in the system (which is a large and complex task), the experimental techniques that are best suited to systems biology are those that can capture data about the system on a large scale or \"system-wide.\" This means techniques that gather data from many components simultaneously, rather than focusing on one or a few at a time. High throughput techniques?? These are merely technologies that can generate a vast amount of data quickly and on a large scale, which are critical in systems biology. These methods provide the quantitative data (i.e. numerical measurements) needed to build and validate computational models. These models can then be used to predict how the system behaves, how it responds to changes, or how the interactions between components lead to the overall function of the system. e.g. NGS (Next-generation sequencing) A technique that rapidly sequences large amounts of DNA or RNA, generating vast data. Processing this data often involves GPUs or multiprocessing to handle the massive computational demands for alignment, assembly, and analysis efficiently. Role of ICT (Information Communication Technologies) Management (store, integrate, query, search, retrieve, ...) and analysis of data and information (knowledge) Development of models and algorithms Implementation of instruments and services Creation of visualization tools Modern Bioinformatics and Computational Biology were born with the DNA sequencing projects The sequencing of human DNA was first proposed in 1984 at a conference organized by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). This idea eventually led to the launch of the Human Genome Project in 1990, an international effort to map and sequence the entire human genome. A first draft of the project was finished and available to the public by June 2000. The project was then completed in 2003, providing a complete blueprint of human DNA. In June 2000, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (a public effort) and the private company Celera Genomics announced the completion of the first draft of the human genome. This milestone marked significant progress in understanding human genetics. The first draft sequence was completed in October 2000 and later published in February 2001, with both the consortium and Celera publishing their results. This draft provided a rough map of the human genome, identifying most of the genetic material but leaving some gaps and areas that required further refinement. The private company Celera Genomics announced the completion of the first draft of the human genome. This milestone marked significant progress in understanding human genetics. The first draft sequence was completed in October 2000 and later published in February 2001, with both the consortium and Celera publishing their results The Human Genome Project (HGP) Providing a complete, high-quality sequence of human genomic DNA to the research community as a freely, publicly available resource. Goals Human DNA sequence variation Finding and mapping common and less common variants : Identify genetic differences, both frequent and rare, across the population. These variations can help explain why some individuals are more prone to certain diseases or traits. Making the information available : Share these findings in public databases so researchers worldwide can access and utilize them. Develop algorithms for using such information : Create tools to efficiently analyze genetic variations, linking them to health outcomes or disease risks. Comparative genomics Interpreting the human genome sequence : Compare the human genome to those of other species to better understand how certain parts of our DNA contribute to biological functions. Functions of conserved sequences : Identify DNA sequences that are similar across species, which likely serve important roles (e.g., regulating genes or coding for essential proteins). Support experiments in model systems Functional analysis of genes Proteins : Study how genes encode proteins, which carry out most cellular tasks. Coding regions : Investigate sections of DNA that directly instruct cells to build proteins. Other functional elements of the genome : Explore non-coding regions that play roles in regulating genes or maintaining chromosome structure. High-throughput, genome-wide basis : Use technologies that analyze thousands of genes or proteins at once to collect data on gene activity and interactions. Genome informatics Data analysis methods : Sequence analysis : Examine the order of DNA bases (A, T, C, G) to identify genes and their functions. Gene mapping : Locate specific genes on chromosomes. Complex trait mapping : Study how multiple genes contribute to traits like height or disease susceptibility. Genetic variation : Analyze differences in DNA that may impact health. Functional analysis : Determine what different parts of the genome do. Development of database tools : Build software that allows scientists to store, access, and analyze genetic data. Development and maintenance of databases : Maintain large collections of genomic data for public use. \ud83d\udca1 Difference between terms DNA, Genes and Genome DNA : The molecule that contains genetic instructions for the development and function of living organisms. Genes : Specific segments of DNA that contain instructions to make proteins, which perform most functions in a cell. Genome : The complete set of DNA in an organism, including all of its genes and non-coding regions. After the publishing of the complete sequence of the human genome in 2001 start the \"post-genomic era\": The complete human DNA sequence is known Much must still to be yet understood: What are all the genes in the DNA and where do they start and end? What are all the DNA components? How do they interact with each other in a \"systemic way\" ? What is their function ; how is it altered in pathologies ; how to correct such alterations ? What's Molecular medicine? Molecular medicine is a broad field, where physical , chemical , biological , and medical techniques are used to describe molecular structures and mechanisms , identify fundamental molecular and genetic errors of disease , and to develop molecular interventions to correct them. The molecular medicine perspective emphasizes cellular and molecular phenomena and interventions rather than the previous conceptual and observational focus on patients and their organs. Therefore, molecular medicine is interconnected with and develops into pharmacogenomics , which in turn has molecular medicine as its application focus. What is Pharmacogenomics? Pharmacogenomics is the branch of pharmacology that deals with the influence of genetic variation on drug response in patients by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms with a drug's efficacy or toxicity . By doing so, pharmacogenomics aims to develop rational means to optimize drug therapy , with respect to the patients' genotype , to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects and economical burden . Such approaches promise the advent of \" personalized medicine \", in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for each individual's unique genetic makeup .

These traits are governed by genes . Biology : The science that studies the structure, function, and interactions of living organisms, as well as the conditions necessary for life. Molecular Biology : A field of biology that investigates living organisms at the molecular level, particularly focusing on the interactions of macromolecules like proteins, DNA , and RNA , which underlie biological processes. Characteristics of Living Beings All living organisms share seven key characteristics that distinguish them from non-living matter: Structural Complexity : Organisms possess intricate structures at multiple levels, from the macroscopic (whole organisms) to the cellular and intracellular levels. Organization : Living beings exhibit highly ordered and functional structures. Macroscopic level : such as animals and plants. Microscopic level : including cellular and intracellular organization. Energy Utilization : Organisms derive energy from their environment (e.g., solar energy, chemical energy from food) to perform work, build, and maintain their structure. Reproduction : Organisms have the ability to reproduce, ensuring the continuation of their species by passing down essential characteristics. Development : In more complex organisms, a single cell can differentiate into multiple cell types, forming specialized tissues. Response to Stimuli : Living organisms react to environmental cues to maximize their survival with minimal energy expenditure. For example: Movement in response to predators or light (in plants). Adjustments to changing climates. Evolution : According to the majority of biologists, organisms undergo evolutionary changes over time, allowing them to adapt and transform in response to their environment. The cell The biological unit of all living beings is the cell Organisms: unicellular (made up of only one cell) multi-cellular (made up of a variable number of cells); on average, human being have about 37.2 trillions cells Depending on their structure the cells can be divided into: Prokaryotes : have a nucleus not clearly separated from the rest of cellular matter Eukaryotes : cells having a well defined structure Prokaryotes Prokaryotes are unicellular organisms , meaning they consist of only one cell. They are considered the most simple and ancient life forms on Earth. Unlike more complex cells (eukaryotes), prokaryotes lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria , a major group of prokaryotes, are the most numerous living organisms on the planet. They come in different shapes , which can be used to classify them: Coccus (plural: cocci) : These bacteria are spherical or round-shaped (a). Bacillus (plural: bacilli) : These bacteria are rod-shaped or stick-like (b). Spirillum (plural: spirilla) : These bacteria have a spiral or corkscrew shape (c). The diversity in bacterial shapes is related to their function and movement : Cocci : These tend to be non-motile or move in simple ways and often form clusters or chains. Bacilli : These rod-shaped bacteria can have flagella for movement and are commonly involved in nutrient cycling. Spirilla : These bacteria are more mobile , often moving using flagella (whip-like structures) to propel themselves, typically found in aquatic environments. Examples of Bacteria Vibrio : A comma-shaped bacterium (related to cholera). Staphylococci : A cluster-forming spherical bacterium (related to infections like staph). Bacillus : A rod-shaped bacterium, often involved in decomposing organic matter. Spirillum with flagella : A spiral-shaped bacterium that uses flagella to move, often found in stagnant water. These structural variations in bacteria help them adapt to different environments, aiding in their survival and interaction with other organisms, including humans. Eukaryotes Eukaryotic cells are more complex than prokaryotic cells and have a well-defined internal structure. They are found in all multicellular organisms (like animals, plants, fungi, and humans) as well as some unicellular organisms (like certain protists). Plasma membrane : Eukaryotic cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane , which acts as a barrier controlling what enters and exits the cell. The membrane also maintains the cell's integrity and supports communication between the cell and its environment. Cytoplasm : Inside the plasma membrane, there is cytoplasm , which consists of a gel-like substance that fills the cell. This cytoplasm contains all the cellular components and allows for the movement of materials within the cell. Nucleus : Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells have a well-defined nucleus that contains the cell's genetic material (DNA). The nucleus is enclosed by a nuclear envelope , a double membrane that separates the genetic material from the rest of the cell and controls the exchange of materials between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The nucleus is the control center of the cell, regulating cell growth, division, and function by directing protein synthesis. Chromosomes : Thread-like structures made of DNA and proteins found in the nucleus. They contain the cell\u2019s genetic information and are crucial during cell division, ensuring DNA is accurately replicated and distributed. Ribosomes : Small structures either floating freely in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum . Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis by translating genetic instructions into polypeptides (protein chains). Organelles : In the cytoplasm, eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles , which perform specific vital functions necessary for the cell\u2019s survival and operation. Some key organelles include: Mitochondria : Often referred to as the \"powerhouses\" of the cell, mitochondria generate energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through a process called cellular respiration . Mitochondria play a crucial role in energy metabolism and are essential for powering various cellular activities. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) : The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes that helps in the production and transport of proteins and lipids . There are two types: Rough ER (studded with ribosomes): Involved in the synthesis of proteins that are either secreted from the cell or sent to the cell membrane. Smooth ER (lacks ribosomes): Responsible for lipid synthesis and detoxification of harmful substances. Golgi apparatus : The Golgi apparatus functions like the cell's \"post office.\" It modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids made in the ER before they are sent to their final destination within or outside the cell. It plays a critical role in the secretion of proteins and in forming lysosomes. Lysosome : These are small vesicles containing digestive enzymes. They break down waste materials, old cell parts, and foreign invaders, helping to maintain cellular health through waste disposal and recycling. The four main types of biological macromolecules Proteins Function : Proteins are the workhorses of the cell , performing a wide range of functions. They are involved in almost every cellular process, including enzymatic reactions (as enzymes), structural support (e.g., collagen), transport (e.g., hemoglobin), signaling (e.g., hormones like insulin), and immune responses (e.g., antibodies). Structure : Proteins are composed of long chains of amino acids , which are folded into specific shapes. The shape of a protein determines its function. Importance : Without proteins, cells wouldn't be able to carry out vital tasks, such as metabolizing nutrients, moving molecules across membranes, or communicating with other cells. Polysaccharides Function : Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates made up of long chains of sugar molecules. They play crucial roles in energy storage (e.g., glycogen in animals, starch in plants) and as structural components (e.g., cellulose in plant cell walls). Structure : These molecules are polymers of simple sugars (monosaccharides), such as glucose. When many of these sugar units are linked together, they form polysaccharides. Importance : Polysaccharides are important for providing cells with energy and structure . For example, plants use cellulose to maintain their rigidity, and animals store glycogen as a quick energy source. Lipids Function : Lipids, including fats, oils, and phospholipids , are essential for energy storage , cell membrane structure , and acting as signaling molecules (e.g., hormones). Structure : Lipids are not polymers like proteins or polysaccharides. They are made up of fatty acids and glycerol . In cell membranes, they form a bilayer that acts as a barrier, protecting the cell and controlling what enters and exits. Importance : Lipids play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the cell membrane, enabling cells to keep their shape and protect their contents. They also serve as long-term energy storage and are involved in cell signaling . Nucleic acids Function : Nucleic acids, including DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid), are responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information . DNA holds the instructions for building proteins, while RNA translates these instructions into action during protein synthesis. Structure : Nucleic acids are composed of nucleotides , which consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. In DNA, these bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil (U). Importance : DNA is essential for heredity and provides the blueprint for all cellular functions. RNA plays a key role in protein synthesis by reading and translating DNA's instructions. Proteins Proteins are polymers constituted by chains of amino acids (monomers). There are 20 different amino acids that make up proteins: Alanine (Ala, A) Cysteine (Cys, C) Aspartic acid (Asp, D) Glutamic acid (Glu, E) Phenylalanine (Phe, F) Glycine (Gly, G) Histidine (His, H) Isoleucine (Ile, I) Lysine (Lys, K) Leucine (Leu, L) Methionine (Met, M) Asparagine (Asn, N) Proline (Pro, P) Glutamine (Gln, Q) Arginine (Arg, R) Serine (Ser, S) Threonine (Thr, T) Valine (Val, V) Tryptophan (Trp, W) Tyrosine (Tyr, Y) Amino acids are molecules composed of the following components: 1 central atom of carbon (C), linked to: 1 atom of hydrogen (H) 1 amino group (-NH\u2082) 1 carboxylate group (-COOH) 1 side chain (R), which varies for each amino acid (e.g., Ala, Cys, Asp, etc.) The side chain (R-group) is what differentiates each amino acid and influences how they interact in protein folding and function. Amino acids (proteins) can have different functions: Structural (they constitute the cell\u2019s frame) Enzymatic (catalyze (allow) the majority of cellular reactions) Hormonal (execute regulative functions) Immunity (defense from other entities, mediated by the Immunoglobulines) Polysaccharides Polysaccharides are polymers made up of long chains of monosaccharides (simple sugars like glucose). They serve various functions, including energy storage and structural support in living organisms. Glycogen : Glycogen is the primary energy storage polysaccharide in animals . It is highly branched and is stored mainly in the liver and muscles . When the body needs energy, glycogen is quickly broken down into glucose, which cells use for energy production (ATP). This makes it a crucial instant energy reservoir . Starch (Amid) : Starch is the most important energy storage polysaccharide in plants . It consists of two components: Amylose : A linear chain of glucose molecules. Amylopectin : A branched form of glucose. Plants store starch in structures like chloroplasts or amyloplasts , and it serves as a long-term energy reserve that can be broken down into glucose when needed for growth or energy. Cellulose : Cellulose is another polysaccharide found in plants , but unlike starch, it plays a structural role . It forms the cell wall of plant cells, providing rigidity and strength to the plant structure. Unlike starch and glycogen, cellulose is made of beta-glucose units, which humans cannot digest, but it\u2019s a critical fiber source in the diet. In summary, polysaccharides are essential for: Energy storage (glycogen in animals, starch in plants). Structural support (cellulose in plants). Lipids (Fats) Lipids, also known as fats, are hydrophobic molecules that play key roles in energy storage, structural components of membranes, and signaling. Cellular membrane constituents : Lipids, especially phospholipids , are the main components of the cell membrane . The membrane is made up of a phospholipid bilayer , which creates a barrier that protects the cell from the external environment and regulates what enters and exits the cell. The hydrophobic tails of phospholipids ensure that the membrane remains selectively permeable. Energy reservoir : Lipids also act as a long-term energy storage . They store more energy per gram compared to carbohydrates like glycogen. When the body runs low on carbohydrates, it breaks down lipids into fatty acids and glycerol, which can be used to generate ATP. This makes them an important energy source when carbohydrates are scarce. Triglycerides , a type of lipid, are stored in adipose tissue in animals and are used as an energy reserve during fasting or periods of intense activity.","title":"Concepts of Genetics and Molecular Biology"},{"location":"lectures/bioinformatics-and-computational-biology/main-concepts.html#concepts-of-genetics-and-molecular-biology","text":"Concepts of Genetics and Molecular Biology Definitions Characteristics of Living Beings The cell Prokaryotes Eukaryotes The four main types of biological macromolecules Proteins Polysaccharides Lipids (Fats)","title":"Concepts of Genetics and Molecular Biology"},{"location":"lectures/bioinformatics-and-computational-biology/main-concepts.html#definitions","text":"Genetics : The branch of biology that explores heredity, focusing on how traits are passed from one generation to the next.

Bacillus : A rod-shaped bacterium, often involved in decomposing organic matter. Spirillum with flagella : A spiral-shaped bacterium that uses flagella to move, often found in stagnant water. These structural variations in bacteria help them adapt to different environments, aiding in their survival and interaction with other organisms, including humans.","title":"Prokaryotes"},{"location":"lectures/bioinformatics-and-computational-biology/main-concepts.html#eukaryotes","text":"Eukaryotic cells are more complex than prokaryotic cells and have a well-defined internal structure. They are found in all multicellular organisms (like animals, plants, fungi, and humans) as well as some unicellular organisms (like certain protists). Plasma membrane : Eukaryotic cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane , which acts as a barrier controlling what enters and exits the cell. The membrane also maintains the cell's integrity and supports communication between the cell and its environment. Cytoplasm : Inside the plasma membrane, there is cytoplasm , which consists of a gel-like substance that fills the cell. This cytoplasm contains all the cellular components and allows for the movement of materials within the cell. Nucleus : Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells have a well-defined nucleus that contains the cell's genetic material (DNA). The nucleus is enclosed by a nuclear envelope , a double membrane that separates the genetic material from the rest of the cell and controls the exchange of materials between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The nucleus is the control center of the cell, regulating cell growth, division, and function by directing protein synthesis. Chromosomes : Thread-like structures made of DNA and proteins found in the nucleus. They contain the cell\u2019s genetic information and are crucial during cell division, ensuring DNA is accurately replicated and distributed. Ribosomes : Small structures either floating freely in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum . Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis by translating genetic instructions into polypeptides (protein chains). Organelles : In the cytoplasm, eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles , which perform specific vital functions necessary for the cell\u2019s survival and operation. Some key organelles include: Mitochondria : Often referred to as the \"powerhouses\" of the cell, mitochondria generate energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through a process called cellular respiration . Mitochondria play a crucial role in energy metabolism and are essential for powering various cellular activities. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) : The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes that helps in the production and transport of proteins and lipids . There are two types: Rough ER (studded with ribosomes): Involved in the synthesis of proteins that are either secreted from the cell or sent to the cell membrane. Smooth ER (lacks ribosomes): Responsible for lipid synthesis and detoxification of harmful substances. Golgi apparatus : The Golgi apparatus functions like the cell's \"post office.\" It modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids made in the ER before they are sent to their final destination within or outside the cell. It plays a critical role in the secretion of proteins and in forming lysosomes. Lysosome : These are small vesicles containing digestive enzymes. They break down waste materials, old cell parts, and foreign invaders, helping to maintain cellular health through waste disposal and recycling.","title":"Eukaryotes"},{"location":"lectures/bioinformatics-and-computational-biology/main-concepts.html#the-four-main-types-of-biological-macromolecules","text":"Proteins Function : Proteins are the workhorses of the cell , performing a wide range of functions. They are involved in almost every cellular process, including enzymatic reactions (as enzymes), structural support (e.g., collagen), transport (e.g., hemoglobin), signaling (e.g., hormones like insulin), and immune responses (e.g., antibodies). Structure : Proteins are composed of long chains of amino acids , which are folded into specific shapes. The shape of a protein determines its function. Importance : Without proteins, cells wouldn't be able to carry out vital tasks, such as metabolizing nutrients, moving molecules across membranes, or communicating with other cells. Polysaccharides Function : Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates made up of long chains of sugar molecules. They play crucial roles in energy storage (e.g., glycogen in animals, starch in plants) and as structural components (e.g., cellulose in plant cell walls). Structure : These molecules are polymers of simple sugars (monosaccharides), such as glucose. When many of these sugar units are linked together, they form polysaccharides. Importance : Polysaccharides are important for providing cells with energy and structure . For example, plants use cellulose to maintain their rigidity, and animals store glycogen as a quick energy source. Lipids Function : Lipids, including fats, oils, and phospholipids , are essential for energy storage , cell membrane structure , and acting as signaling molecules (e.g., hormones). Structure : Lipids are not polymers like proteins or polysaccharides. They are made up of fatty acids and glycerol . In cell membranes, they form a bilayer that acts as a barrier, protecting the cell and controlling what enters and exits. Importance : Lipids play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the cell membrane, enabling cells to keep their shape and protect their contents. They also serve as long-term energy storage and are involved in cell signaling . Nucleic acids Function : Nucleic acids, including DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid), are responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information . DNA holds the instructions for building proteins, while RNA translates these instructions into action during protein synthesis. Structure : Nucleic acids are composed of nucleotides , which consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. In DNA, these bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil (U). Importance : DNA is essential for heredity and provides the blueprint for all cellular functions. RNA plays a key role in protein synthesis by reading and translating DNA's instructions.","title":"The four main types of biological macromolecules"},{"location":"lectures/bioinformatics-and-computational-biology/main-concepts.html#proteins","text":"Proteins are polymers constituted by chains of amino acids (monomers).

Amino acids (proteins) can have different functions: Structural (they constitute the cell\u2019s frame) Enzymatic (catalyze (allow) the majority of cellular reactions) Hormonal (execute regulative functions) Immunity (defense from other entities, mediated by the Immunoglobulines)","title":"Proteins"},{"location":"lectures/bioinformatics-and-computational-biology/main-concepts.html#polysaccharides","text":"Polysaccharides are polymers made up of long chains of monosaccharides (simple sugars like glucose). They serve various functions, including energy storage and structural support in living organisms. Glycogen : Glycogen is the primary energy storage polysaccharide in animals . It is highly branched and is stored mainly in the liver and muscles . When the body needs energy, glycogen is quickly broken down into glucose, which cells use for energy production (ATP). This makes it a crucial instant energy reservoir . Starch (Amid) : Starch is the most important energy storage polysaccharide in plants . It consists of two components: Amylose : A linear chain of glucose molecules. Amylopectin : A branched form of glucose. Plants store starch in structures like chloroplasts or amyloplasts , and it serves as a long-term energy reserve that can be broken down into glucose when needed for growth or energy. Cellulose : Cellulose is another polysaccharide found in plants , but unlike starch, it plays a structural role . It forms the cell wall of plant cells, providing rigidity and strength to the plant structure. Unlike starch and glycogen, cellulose is made of beta-glucose units, which humans cannot digest, but it\u2019s a critical fiber source in the diet. In summary, polysaccharides are essential for: Energy storage (glycogen in animals, starch in plants). Structural support (cellulose in plants).","title":"Polysaccharides"},{"location":"lectures/bioinformatics-and-computational-biology/main-concepts.html#lipids-fats","text":"Lipids, also known as fats, are hydrophobic molecules that play key roles in energy storage, structural components of membranes, and signaling. Cellular membrane constituents : Lipids, especially phospholipids , are the main components of the cell membrane . The membrane is made up of a phospholipid bilayer , which creates a barrier that protects the cell from the external environment and regulates what enters and exits the cell. The hydrophobic tails of phospholipids ensure that the membrane remains selectively permeable. Energy reservoir : Lipids also act as a long-term energy storage . They store more energy per gram compared to carbohydrates like glycogen. When the body runs low on carbohydrates, it breaks down lipids into fatty acids and glycerol, which can be used to generate ATP. This makes them an important energy source when carbohydrates are scarce. Triglycerides , a type of lipid, are stored in adipose tissue in animals and are used as an energy reserve during fasting or periods of intense activity.","title":"Lipids (Fats)"},{"location":"lectures/genetics-cellular-and-molecular-biology/index.html","text":"Genetics, Cellular, and Molecular Biology Welcome to the course on Genetics, Cellular, and Molecular Biology.

Conjugate bases are more stable. Across a Period (e.g., CH\u2084 to HF) Acidity increases Basicity decreases More electronegative atoms across a period hold onto negative charge better, making stronger acids. Electronegativity Higher electronegativity = stronger acid Lower electronegativity = stronger base More electronegative atoms stabilize the conjugate base better, increasing acidity. Atomic Size Larger atoms = stronger acid Smaller atoms = stronger base Larger atoms stabilize the negative charge in the conjugate base, enhancing acidity. Inductive Effect Electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity Electron-donating groups increase basicity Electronegative groups near acidic sites pull electron density, stabilizing the conjugate base. Resonance Resonance stabilization increases acidity Resonance decreases basicity Delocalization of negative charge stabilizes the conjugate base, favoring acidity. Hybridization More s-character = stronger acid Less s-character = stronger base \\(sp\\) hybridized atoms hold negative charge closer, stabilizing the conjugate base.

Organic chemistry is the study of chemistry compounds that contain the element carbon, many of which are found in living organisms. It is one branch in the entire field chemistry, which encompasses many subdisciplines. There are far more organic compounds than any other type. Medicines Food Clothing Gasoline Soaps Refrigerants Features of organic compounds All organic compounds contain carbon atoms C and most hydrogen atoms H . All the carbon atoms have 4 bonds, a stable carbon atom is said to be tetravalent. Any other atom that is not a carbon or a hydrogen is called \"heteroatom\". Common heteroatoms includes N , O , S , P and the halogens . The halogens are a group of elements found in Group 17 of the periodic table. Some compunds have chains of atoms while other have rings. A chain structure consists of carbon atoms connected in a straight or branched sequence. A ring structure occurs when the carbon atoms are connected in a loop or circle. The periodic table Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev published the first recognizable periodic table in 1869, developed mainly to illustrate periodic trends of the then-known elements Mendeleev's idea has been slowly expanded and refined leading to the new and modern periodic table as we know it to this day. A periodic table is made up of rows (periods) and columuns (groups): - Period: - A period on the periodic table is a row of chemical elements. - All elements in a row have the same number of electron shells. - Each next element in a period has one more proton and is less metallic than its predecessor . Group: A group refers to a vertical column in the periodic table. Elements in the same group have the same number of electrons in their outermost shell (valence electrons). Electrons in this regions determine the chemical properties that elements in the same group have in common. Group 1 elements (like sodium Na and potassium K ) have one valence electron, making them highly reactive metals. The reactivity is driven by their desire to lose this one electron to become more stable. This reactivity of Group 1 elements is due to their strong tendency to lose that one valence electron, which is indeed the fastest way for them to achieve a more stable configuration. This eagerness to lose the electron makes them highly reactive, especially with substances like water or oxygen. Groups contribute to the idea of periodic trends Wikipedia states: In chemistry, periodic trends are specific patterns that are present in the periodic table that illustrate different aspects of certain elements when grouped by period and/or group. Electron Shell: Regions arond the nucleus of an atom where elecrons are likely to be found Each shell can hold a certain max number of electrons and represents a specific energy level. What is the maximum number of shells an atom can have? \"There is no theoretical limit to the number of electron shells an atom can have; however, in practice, elements currently known on the periodic table have up to 7 electron shells.\" Charactestics of a metal Metals are good conductors of electricity and heat because of the free movement of their electrons. They are malleable, meaning they can be shaped or bent without breaking, and they have a shiny, reflective surface, known as luster. Metals can also be drawn into thin wires, a property called ductility. Generally, metals are dense and solid at room temperature, except for mercury, which is liquid. Lastly, metals tend to be reactive, often losing electrons easily during chemical reactions, forming positive ions (cations).","title":"Organic Chemistry, Academic Year 2024/2025"},{"location":"lectures/organic-chemistry/lesson-1_17-09-2024-introduction.html#organic-chemistry-academic-year-20242025","text":"References : - laura.belvisi@unimi.it - daniele.passarella@unimi.it Organic Chemistry, Academic Year 2024/2025 Program of the Course Suggested Reference Textbooks / Teaching Materials Recommendations: Course Web Page What is Organic Chemistry?

Surrounding the nucleus are electrons (negatively charged), which move in regions called electron shells or orbitals. These shells represent different energy levels, with the electrons closest to the nucleus having lower energy and those further away having higher energy . Identity and behavior : The number of protons defines the element, while the arrangement of electrons influences the atom's chemical behavior. Atomic number The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element Mass number The mass number is the number of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus The atomic weight of a particular element is the weighted average of the mass of all its isotopes reported in atomic mass unit (amu). This difference in neutron count causes the isotopes to have different atomic masses (mass number = protons + neutrons), while still being the same element. For this particular reason the atomic mass of a given element is calculated as a weighted average. \ud83d\udca1 What is an isotope of a given element? An isotope of an element refers to atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. This means that isotopes of an element have the same atomic number (same number of protons) but different mass numbers (total number of protons and neutrons). For example, carbon has two common isotopes: Carbon-12 (6 protons and 6 neutrons) and Carbon-14 (6 protons and 8 neutrons). Charged ions An ion is an atom that has gained or lost one or more electrons, resulting in a net charge Cations Ions with a positive because they have lost electons. Anions Ions with a negative charge because they have gained an electron. Atomic Orbitals Atomic orbitals are regions around an atom's nucleus where there is a high probability of finding an electron. Orbitals are described by quantum mechanics and represent the wave-like behavior of electrons around the nucleus. Each orbital has a specific shape and energy level. S Orbital s orbitals are spherical because the probability distribution of finding an electron is the same in every direction around the nucleus. This spherical symmetry results from the mathematical solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for an electron in a hydrogen atom. P Orbitals p orbitals are a type of atomic orbital with a dumbbell or figure-eight shape, and they are more complex than s orbitals An element presenting p orbitals arrangements is comprised of 3 p orbital, one for each 3-Dimensional axis repectively: Px, Py and Pz. Each p orbital has two lobes extending outwards starting from the nucleus, resembling a dumbbell shape. These lobes represent regions where the probability of finding an electron is highest. Between the two lobes, at the nucleus, there is a node, where the probability of finding an electron is zero. Each p orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. This has something to do with the Pauli Exclusion Principle which is stuff coming from Quantum Mechanics. The priciple states that: > \"No two electrons in the same orbital can have the same quantum numbers\" for whatever this means... You can literally imagine the shape as dictating where there's a high probability of finding an electron. Shells, subshells and energy levels Energy levels are labeled by the pricipal quantum number n (1, 2, 3 and so on...). As you go up in energy levels the energy increases and so does the capacity to hold more electrons. The total number of electrons in an energy level is given by 2n^2 First shell can hold 2(1**2) = 2 electrons Second shell can hold 2(2**2) = 8 electrons Third shell can hold 2(3**2) = 18 electrons Each energy level contains one or more subshells (s, p, d and f). These subshells are represented in the diagram: 1st shell: 1s (can hold 2 electrons). 2nd shell: 2s and 2p (together can hold 8 electrons: 2 in 2s and 6 in 2p). 3rd shell: 3s, 3p, and 3d (together can hold 18 electrons: 2 in 3s, 6 in 3p, and 10 in 3d). ... Each subshell has a certain amount of orbitals and each orbital can hold two electrons \ud83d\udca1 Videos and resources Gumball Degree: Shells, Subshells, and Orbitals : simple video on bohr's model Some guy rendering p type subshells Three Twentysix: What ARE atomic orbitals? : great video explaining the concept of electron density and why subshells are represented as shapes, which aren't really electron containers but rather a density plot of the places where an electron is most likely to be found around it's atom. minutephysics: A Better Way To Picture Atoms Sci Pills: Atomic orbitals 3D : Shows realistic 3D pictures of the simplest atomic orbitals of hydrogen Atom wave functions (animation) BOHR's Atomic model Subshells shapes Orbitals and sub-orbitals (or shells and subshells) of Bound Electrons u/BayGO said on reddit : \"A Suborbital simply refers to the \"type\" (shape) of the orbital that the electron is orbiting around.\"* Notes on the periodic table First row There is only one orbital in the first shell Each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons There are two elements in the first row H (Hydrogen 1s^1) He (Helium 12^2) Second row Each element in the second row of the periodic table also has four orbitals available to accept additional electrons: one 2s orbital. and three 2p orbitals. There is a maximum capacity of eight valence electrons for elements in the second row. From the slides: In orbitals at the same energy, electrons are distributed one per orbital, then the second is added This really means that electrons prefering falling into an empty orbital at the same energy level rather that pairing up in an already occupied orbital. This is due to reduced electron-electron repulsion. Going deeper: When electrons are placed singly in different orbitals of the same subshell, they will all have the same spin direction (either all up or all down). Electrons have a property called spin, which is like a small magnetic field. It can be thought of as spinning in one of two possible directions, often represented as: Up spin (denoted as \u2191) Down spin (denoted as \u2193) > Chemical bonding In this context, bonding refers to the joining of two atoms in a stable arrangement. Through bonding, atoms gain, lose or share electrons to attain the electronic configuration of the noble gas closest to them in the periodic table. \ud83d\udca1 What is a noble gas? A noble gas is an element whose outermost energy level (also called \"valence shell\") is completely filled with electrons. Atoms can either form ionic or covalent bonds to attain a complete outershell, e.g. seeking stability. Ionic bonds result from the transfer of an electron from one atom to another. Covalent bonds result from the sharing of electrons between two nuclei. Ionic bonds These generally occur when elements from the far left side of the periodic table combine with elements from the far right side, ignoring noble gases. A positively charged cation formed from the element on the left side attracts a negatively charged anion from the element right on side \ud83d\udca1 Why do Na and Cl keep staying close together after the ionic bonds (the electron was transferred), aren't they supposed to be stable and thus not needing to stay close? Great question! Let\u2019s clarify why sodium ( \\(\\text{Na}\\) ) and chlorine ( \\(\\text{Cl}\\) ) still have opposite charges after the electron transfer. The key here lies in understanding how the electron transfer affects the total number of protons and electrons in each atom, and how this creates the charges. Before the Transfer: Sodium (Na) : Atomic number = 11 (11 protons, which are positively charged). It also has 11 electrons (negatively charged) in a neutral state. In this state, sodium has no net charge because the positive protons and negative electrons cancel each other out. Chlorine (Cl) : Atomic number = 17 (17 protons). It also has 17 electrons in a neutral state. Similarly, chlorine has no net charge because its positive and negative charges balance out. After the Electron Transfer: Sodium (Na) loses 1 electron: Now sodium has 11 protons (still positively charged) but only 10 electrons (since it lost one electron). This means sodium has 1 more proton than it has electrons. Since protons are positive, sodium becomes a positively charged ion ( \\(\\text{Na}^+\\) ) because it now has an excess positive charge . Chlorine (Cl) gains 1 electron: Chlorine has 17 protons but now 18 electrons (since it gained an electron from sodium). This means chlorine has 1 more electron than it has protons. Since electrons are negative, chlorine becomes a negatively charged ion ( \\(\\text{Cl}^-\\) ) because it now has an excess negative charge . Why Do They Have Opposite Charges? Sodium ( \\(\\text{Na}^+\\) ) becomes positively charged because it has more protons than electrons after losing one electron. Chlorine ( \\(\\text{Cl}^-\\) ) becomes negatively charged because it has more electrons than protons after gaining that electron. Thus, the loss or gain of electrons directly results in an imbalance between protons (positive) and electrons (negative), creating these charges. Sodium is positive because it lost a negative electron, and chlorine is negative because it gained that electron. Summary of the Charge Creation: Sodium (Na) loses 1 electron, leaving it with more protons than electrons , giving it a positive charge ( \\(\\text{Na}^+\\) ). Chlorine (Cl) gains 1 electron, leaving it with more electrons than protons , giving it a negative charge ( \\(\\text{Cl}^-\\) ). These opposite charges result in a strong electrostatic attraction between the \\(\\text{Na}^+\\) and \\(\\text{Cl}^-\\) ions, which forms the ionic bond. Covalent bonding Covalent bonding occurs with elements like carbon in the middle of the table with elements that have similar electronegativity. In a covalent bond, atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. Each atom contributes at least one electron to the bond and these electrons are shared equally or unequally , depending on the atoms involved. Equally Electrons are shared equally between atoms with similar or identical electronegativities, resulting in no significant charge difference. Example : Hydrogen molecule \\(\\text{H}_2\\) \u2013 Both hydrogen atoms share electrons equally because they have the same electronegativity. Unequally Electrons are shared unequally between atoms with different electronegativities, causing partial charges on the atoms (\u03b4\u2212 and \u03b4+). Example : Water \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\) \u2013 Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, leading to unequal sharing of electrons, with oxygen gaining a partial negative charge and hydrogen a partial positive charge. A covalent bond is a two-electron bond and a compound with covalent bonds is called a Molecule . Concept of Polarity: Polarity refers to the unequal sharing of electrons in a bond, leading to regions of slight positive and negative charge, creating a dipole. A bond or molecule is polar if it has such charge separation, while it is nonpolar if the electrons are evenly distributed. Polar Bonds : In a polar covalent bond , one atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the other. This creates a dipole moment , where: The atom that attracts electrons more strongly becomes slightly negative (partial negative charge, \u03b4\u2212). The other atom becomes slightly positive (partial positive charge, \u03b4+). The bond is said to be polar because there is a separation of charge, creating \"poles\" (one positive, one negative). Example : In water \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\) , oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the electrons are pulled closer to oxygen, making oxygen \u03b4\u2212 and hydrogen \u03b4+. Nonpolar Bonds : In a nonpolar covalent bond , the electrons are shared equally between the atoms, so there is no charge separation and no dipole moment. These bonds occur between atoms with the same or very similar electronegativity. Example : In a molecule of oxygen \\(\\text{O}_2\\) , both oxygen atoms share electrons equally, so the bond is nonpolar. Polarity in Molecules: Polar molecules : Molecules with an overall charge separation due to polar bonds and an asymmetrical shape. Water \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\) is polar because of its bent shape and polar bonds. Nonpolar molecules : Molecules where the bonds are either nonpolar, or polar bonds cancel out due to a symmetrical arrangement. \\(\\text{CO}_2\\) (carbon dioxide) is nonpolar because its linear shape causes the polar bonds to cancel each other out. \ud83d\udca1 Videos and resources Creative Learning: Mastering Chemical Bonding: Explained with 3D Animation IslandSchoolHongKong: covalent bond animation AtomicSchool: Chemical Bonding Introduction: Hydrogen Molecule, Covalent Bond & Noble Gases AtomicSchool: Oxygen, Nitrogen & Carbon and Covalent Chemical Bonds Hydrogenic Orbitals visualizer Molecular Orbital visualizer Hydrogen forms one covalent bond, when two hydrogen atoms are joined in a bond, each has a filled valence shell of two electrons. Valence electrons Octet Rule The octet rule states that atoms tend to form bonds in such a way that they achieve a total of 8 electrons in their outermost (valence) shell, which makes them chemically stable. This configuration mimics the electron arrangement of noble gases, which are naturally stable due to having a full outer shell. Second row elements can have no more that eight electrons around them. For neutral molecules, this has two consequences: Atoms with one, two, three or four valence electrons form one, two, three or four bonds, respectively in neutral molecules (e.g. \\(\\text{BF}_3\\) , \\(\\text{CH}_4\\) ) In boron trifluoride \\(\\text{BF}_3\\) , each fluorine atom shares 1 electron with boron, completing fluorine\u2019s octet and giving boron 3 shared electrons in its valence shell. Fluorine has an atomic number of 9, meaning it has 9 electrons: 2 in the first energy level and 7 in the second (valence) shell. The second shell can hold a maximum of 8 electrons, so fluorine is 1 electron short of completing its octet. Boron is one of the exceptions to the octet rule, meaning it can form stable compounds with fewer than 8 electrons in its valence shell. In \\(\\text{BF}_3\\) , boron doesn't need a full octet to be chemically stable. Atoms with 1\u20134 valence electrons form as many bonds as they have valence electrons because they only have that many electrons available to share . These atoms are \"sharing\" their valence electrons with other atoms to reach the octet rule, or 8 electrons in their outer shell. The number of bonds they can form is directly tied to the number of valence electrons they have to offer. Atoms with five or more valence electrons form enough bonds to give an octet (e.g. \\(\\text{NH}_3\\) ) In this case, the predicted number of bonds is given by = 8 - #{valence electrons} These atoms (like nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine) are already close to 8 electrons in their valence shell. Since they already have most of the electrons they need (5, 6, or 7), they are more reactive and eager to form bonds with other atoms to quickly complete their octet. Oxygen, with 6 valence electrons , needs 2 more electrons to complete its octet. It easily achieves this by forming two covalent bonds , where each bond involves sharing one pair of electrons with another atom, allowing oxygen to reach the stable 8-electron configuration. It is always possible for an element having >= 5 valence electrons to reach the octet via covalent bonding. Lewis structures Lewis structures are dot representations for molocules General rules for drawing Lewis structures : Draw only the valence electrons Give every second-row element no more than eight electrons Give each hydrogen two electrons Each atom is represented by its chemical symbol C for Carbon, H for hydrogen, O for Oxygen Dots around the atomic symbol represent the valence electrons Covalent bonds (shared pairs of electrons) are represented by lines between atoms, where each line represents a pair of shared electrons. A single bond is one pair (one line) A double bond is two pairs (two lines) A triple bond is three pairs (three lines) Unshared pairs of electrons that are not involved in bonding are shown as pairs of dots next to the atomic symbol ( lone pairs ) How to draw lewis structures Step 1 : Arrange atoms next to each other that you think are bonded together. Always place Hydrogen and halogens on the periphery because they only form one bond each. Place no more atoms around an atom than the number of bonds it usually forms. Step 2 : Count the electrons Count the number of valence electrons from all atoms Add one electron for each negative charge e.g. For \\(\\text{NO}_3^-\\) (nitrate ion) there is a -1 charge, so you add one additional electron to the total count. Subtract one electron for each positive charge e.g. For \\(\\text{NH}_4^+\\) (ammonium ion) there is a +1 charge, so you subtract one electron from the total count. This gives the total number of electrons that must be used in drawing the Lewis structure. Step 3 : Arrange the electrons around the atoms. Place a bond between every two atoms, giving two electrons to each H and no more than eight to any second row atom. For each bond between atoms, place a single line (representing a pair of shared electrons). Each hydrogen (H) should receive two electrons (a single bond), while atoms in the second row of the periodic table (like carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen) should not exceed eight electrons (the octet rule). Use all remaining electrons to fill octets with lone pairs. After placing bonds, assign any remaining electrons as lone pairs on the atoms to complete their octet. Hydrogen atoms already have their 2 electrons from the single bond, so focus on completing the octets for the other atoms. If all valence electrons are used and atoms do not have an octet, form multiple bonds. Ethylene structure \\(\\text{C}_2\\text{H}_4\\) H H | | H \u2014 C = C \u2014 H | | H H Step 4 : Assign formal charges to all atoms Formal Charge is the charge assigned to individual atoms in a Lewis structure Formal charge is calculated as follows: formal charge = #{valence electrons} - #{electrons owned by the atom} or formal charge = #{valence electrons} - (#{non-bonding electrons + #{bonding electrons}/2 }) The number of electrons owned by an atom is determined by its number of bonds and lone pairs. The number of electrons owned by different atoms is indicated in the following examples C with four bonds C shares eight electrons C owns four electrons | \u2014 C \u2014 | C molecule with double bond and sided single bonds Each C shares eight electrons Each C owns four electrons \\ / C = C / \\ C with three bonds and a lone pair C has six shared electrons C has two unshared electrons (lone pair) C owns five electrons | \u2014 C : | This arrangement creates a formal charge of value -1 . Exceptions to the octet rule Incomplete octet Some atoms are stable with fewer than 8 electrons in their valence shell. This is common for elements that have only a few valence electrons and are unable to to form enought bonds to react the octet. B (Boron): this element often forms compounds like \\(\\text{BF}_3\\) (boron trifluoride), where it only has 6 electrons in its valence shell, not 8. Boron is stable in this electron-deficient state. Be (Beryllium): this other element forms compounds like \\(\\text{BeCl}_2\\) where it has only 4 electrons in its valence shell. Expanded octet Seen in elements like phosphorus, sulfur, and xenon, where they can have more than 8 electrons by using d-orbitals. \u26a0\ufe0f Not covered here as out of scope. Odd number of electrons Some molecules have an odd number of electrons, meaning it's impossible for every atom to have 8 electrons. These molecules are called radicals and are stable despite having unpaired electrons. \\(\\text{NO}_2\\) (Nitrogen dioxide): Within this molecule, nitrogen has 5 valence electrons, and the molecule has a total of 17 electrons. This leaves on electron unpaired, making it radical. Nitrogen does not have 8 electrons in its valence shell. \\(\\text{NO}\\) (Nitric Oxide): A molecule with has 11 electrons and does not follow the octet rule due to the odd number of electrons. Resonance structures Some molecules cannot be adequately represented by a single Lewis structure These structures are called resonance structures or resonance forms . A double headed arrow is used to separate the two resonance structures. Resonance structures are two Lewis structures having the same atoms placement but a different arrangement of electrons. Resonance structures are different possible Lewis structures for the same molecule that have the same arrangement of atoms but different distributions of electrons, particularly the location of double bonds or lone pairs. Principles of resonance theory Resonance structures are not real : An individual resonance structure does not accurately represent the structure of a molecule or ion. Only the hybrid does. Resonance structures are not in equilibrium with each other. Resonance structures are not isomers: Two isomers differ in the arrangement of both atoms and electrons, whereas resonance structures differ only in the arrangement of electrons. What really is resonance? Resonance is the phenomenon where the true electronic structure of a molecule cannot be represented by just one Lewis structure. Instead, the real structure is a weighted average (or blend) of all possible resonance structures. Resonance helps stabilize molecules by allowing the electron density to be distributed over a larger area. What is a resonance hybrid? The resonance hybrid is the actual structure of the molecule that results from averaging all the possible resonance structures. It represents the delocalized electron distribution across the molecule. See how to visualize it Neither of the resonance structures is an accurate representation for \\(\\text{(NCONH)}^-\\) The true structure is actually a composite of the two structures represented above and is called a resonance hybrid The hybrid shows characteristics of both structures. Resonance allows certain electron pairs to be delocalized over two or more atoms, and this delocalization adds stability. A molecule with two or more resonance forms is said to be resonance stabilized . Curved arrow notation Curved arrow notation is a convention that shows how electron position differs between two resonance forms Curved arrow notation shows the movement of an electron pair. The tail of the arrow always begins at the electron pair, either in a bond or lone pair. The head points to where the electron pair moves. Two different resonance structures can be drawn when a lone pair is located on an atom directly bonded to a double bond. If an atom having a lone pair in single bonded to another atom having a some double bond. That double bond is lost into a in single bond. The doubly bonded end gains a lone pair. The bofore singly bonded atom now gains another bond, making it effectively a double bond. Two different resonance structures can be drawn when a lone pair is located on an atom directly bonded to a double bond. Atoms without octets Resonance structures can have an atom with fewer than 8 electrons But they cannot have a second row element with more than 8 electrons Second-row elements (like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) cannot have more than 8 electrons in resonance structures because they follow the octet rule, which states that these elements can accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons in their valence shell. This is due to the fact that second-row elements have only the 2s and 2p orbitals, which can hold a total of 8 electrons (2 in the s orbital and 6 in the p orbitals). Isomers Sometimes, more than one than one arrangement of atoms (Lewis structure) is possible for a given molecular formula Isomers are basically different molecules having the same molecular formula. Ethanol and dimethyl ether are constitutional isomers. Drawing organic molecules, condensed structures All atoms are drawn in, but the two-electron bond lines are generally omitted Instead of writing $ \\text{CH}_3 \\text{CH}_3 \\text{CH}_3 \\text{CH} \\(we can simply group the methyl groups as\\) \\text{(} \\text{CH}_3 \\text{)}_3 $ finally getting to \\(\\text{(} \\text{CH}_3 \\text{)}_3 \\text{CH}\\) , which simpler and easier to understand. Condensed structures simplify molecules by omitting bond lines and lone pairs, while showing atoms next to those they are bonded to. Key points: Atoms next to their bonded partners : E.g., \\(\\text{CH}_3 \\text{CH}_2 \\text{CH}_3\\) for propane. Parentheses for groups : E.g., $ \\text{(CH}_3 \\text{)}_2 \\text{CHOH}$ for isopropanol. No lone pairs shown , but implied for atoms like O and N. Drawing skeletal structures Assume there is a carbon atom at the junction of any two lines or at the end of any line. Assume there are enough hydrogens around each carbon to make it tetravalent. What does tetravalent mean? > Tetravalent means that an atom can form four chemical bonds. In this case, a carbon atom, being tetravalent, will always have four bonds, which can be with other carbon atoms, hydrogens, or other elements. In skeletal structures, when you assume there is a carbon atom at a junction or end of a line, it means you don't draw the carbon explicitly but assume it has enough bonds to other atoms or hydrogens to satisfy its tetravalency. Draw in all heteroatoms and the hydrogens directly bonded to them. Interpreting skeletal structures Skeletal structures with charged carbon atoms A charge on a carbon atom takes the place of one hydrogen atom The charge determines the number of lone pairs. Negatively charged carbon atoms have one lone pair and positively charged atoms have none A lone pair forms when an atom has valence electrons that are not involved in bonding with other atoms. These electrons remain localized on the atom, paired due to their opposite spins. In this image, two different scenarios are illustrated, one involving a positively charged carbon atom (carbocation) and the other involving a negatively charged carbon atom (carbanion) . The main point being shown is how adding a hydrogen atom affects the lone pair of electrons on these charged carbon atoms. Top Scenario (positively charged carbon, carbocation): Carbocation : The carbon atom initially has a positive charge , meaning it has lost an electron, leaving it with only three bonds and no lone pair. Adding One Hydrogen Atom : When a hydrogen atom is added to the positively charged carbon, it forms a new bond between the carbon and hydrogen. However, since the carbon already had three bonds and no extra electrons (due to the positive charge), adding this bond does not create a lone pair on the carbon. Result: No lone pair on the carbon, and it has a full valence of bonds. Bottom Scenario (negatively charged carbon, carbanion): Carbanion : In this case, the carbon atom has a negative charge , meaning it has an extra electron (in addition to its usual four valence electrons). This extra electron sits as a lone pair on the carbon. Adding One Hydrogen Atom : When a hydrogen atom is added to the negatively charged carbon, a new bond forms between the carbon and the hydrogen. Now, the carbon still has one lone pair of electrons left after the bond forms because it originally had five valence electrons (four from carbon and one from the negative charge). Result: One lone pair remains on the carbon, as shown by the two dots. Electron Count in Carbon A neutral carbon atom has 4 valence electrons . In the methyl anion \\(\\text{CH}_3^-\\) , the carbon atom gains one additional electron due to the negative charge, bringing the total number of valence electrons on carbon to 5 . The additional electron in the methyl anion comes from outside the molecule, typically provided by a reducing agent or from the surrounding environment in a chemical reaction. This is how anions generally form: by gaining an extra electron Bonding with Hydrogens The carbon in \\(\\text{CH}_3^-\\) forms three single bonds with three hydrogen atoms. Each of these bonds involves sharing one electron from carbon and one electron from hydrogen. After forming these bonds, 3 of the 5 valence electrons from carbon are involved in bonding. Remaining Electrons (Lone Pair) Carbon now has 2 remaining electrons after forming the three bonds. These 2 remaining electrons are not involved in any bonding, so they form a lone pair of electrons. Why not just one electron? If there were only one non-bonding electron left, the molecule would be a radical , not an anion. But in the case of \\(\\text{CH}_3^-\\) , we have a complete pair of non-bonding electrons (2 electrons), which gives the carbon atom its negative charge. A lone pair always consists of two electrons because electrons pair up due to their spin, and these two non-bonding electrons stay together as a lone pair. Lone pairs on heteroatoms Skeletal structures often leave out lone pairs on heteroatoms, don't forget about them Use formal charge to determine the number of lone pairs. Determining molecular shape Bonds length decreases accross a row of the periodic table as the size of the atom decreases Bond lengths decrease across a row of the periodic table as the size of the atom decreases. This trend occurs because atoms get smaller as you move from left to right across a period due to an increase in the effective nuclear charge. As more protons are added to the nucleus, the electrons are pulled closer , resulting in a smaller atomic radius. When atoms are smaller , their nuclei are closer together in a bond, leading to a shorter bond length. Additionally, as atomic size decreases, the bond strength tends to increase because the overlapping atomic orbitals are more tightly bound due to the smaller size and greater effective nuclear charge , further contributing to a shorter bond length. For example, in a period, the bond length of carbon-carbon bonds is shorter than that of boron-boron bonds because carbon is to the right of boron and has a smaller atomic radius. Bond length increases down a column of the periodic table as the size of an atom increases As you move down a group in the periodic table, atoms have more electron shells , and the outermost electrons are farther from the nucleus . This results in a larger atomic radius . When atoms are larger, the nuclei are farther apart in a bond, leading to a longer bond length. Because the electrons in the outermost shells experience more shielding from inner electrons, the effective nuclear charge is lower, further contributing to the increase in atomic size. For example, in Group 17 (the halogens), the bond length of a hydrogen-fluorine (H-F) bond is shorter than that of a hydrogen-iodine (H-I) bond. This is because iodine is much larger than fluorine, and thus, the bond length increases as the size of the iodine atom increases. \ud83d\udca1 What is the shielding effect? A fenomenon in which ih the inner electrons between the nucleus and the outer (valence) electrons act as a \"shield.\" These inner electrons repel the outer electrons due to their negative charge, reducing the full attractive force exerted by the positively charged nucleus on the valence electrons. As a result, the outer electrons experience a weaker effective nuclear charge (the net positive charge felt by the electrons) than they would if the inner electrons were not present. Average bond length | Bond | Length (pm) | Bond | Length (pm) | Bond | Length (pm) | |--------|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|-------------| | H-H | 74 | H-F | 92 | C-F | 133 | | C-H | 109 | H-Cl | 127 | C-Cl | 177 | | N-H | 101 | H-Br | 141 | C-Br | 194 | | O-H | 96 | H-I | 161 | C-I | 213 | Molecular geometry The number of groups surrounding a particular atom determines its geometry. A group is either an atom or a lone pair of electrons The most stable arrangement keeps these groups as far away from each other as possible. This is exemplified by Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory. Number of Groups Geometry Bond Angle 2 Linear 180\u00b0 3 Trigonal Planar 120\u00b0 4 Tetrahedral 109.5\u00b0 The geometry of a molecule is determined by the number of \"groups\" around a central atom. A group can be: An atom bonded to the central atom A lone pair of electrons that the central atom possesses The arrangement of these groups around the central atom aims to minimize repulsion between them, which leads to a stable geometry. This concept is the foundation of Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory . Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory : The theory states that the electron pairs (bonding pairs and lone pairs) surrounding an atom will position themselves as far apart as possible to minimize repulsion. This helps determine the shape (geometry) of the molecule. Types of Geometries : Linear (180\u00b0 bond angle): Occurs when there are two groups around the central atom. Example: Carbon dioxide ( \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) ) has two oxygen atoms bonded to the carbon atom, resulting in a linear shape. Trigonal Planar (120\u00b0 bond angle): Happens when there are three groups around the central atom. Example: Boron trifluoride ( \\(\\ce{BF3}\\) ), where three fluorine atoms are bonded to boron in a flat triangle. Tetrahedral (109.5\u00b0 bond angle): This shape forms when there are four groups around the central atom. Example: Methane ( \\(\\ce{CH4}\\) ), where four hydrogen atoms are arranged symmetrically around a carbon atom. Effect of Lone Pairs: Lone pairs take up more space than bonding pairs because they are closer to the nucleus. As a result, the presence of lone pairs slightly reduces bond angles. For example, water ( \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) ) has a tetrahedral electron geometry, but because of two lone pairs on the oxygen atom, the bond angle is reduced from 109.5\u00b0 to around 104.5\u00b0, giving the molecule a bent shape. \ud83d\udd17 Resources Hannah Nandor: VESPR Theory Two groups around an atom Two groups Linear carbons connected via triple bond Three groups around an atom Three groups Trigonal planar carbons, connected via double bond Ethylene Four groups around an atom The image on the left shows the tetrahedral geometry of methane ( \\(\\ce{CH4}\\) ) with bond angles of 109.5\u00b0 , which is the preferred arrangement for four groups around a central atom like carbon. The tetrahedral geometry is predicted by Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory , which states that electron pairs (bonding and lone pairs) will arrange themselves as far apart as possible to minimize repulsion. The image on the right shows a square planar arrangement with bond angles of 90\u00b0 , which does not occur in methane or similar molecules with four groups around the central atom. This is because: Electron Repulsion : A square planar arrangement forces the bonding groups (hydrogen atoms) closer together, resulting in bond angles of 90\u00b0. This creates much more repulsion between the bonding pairs of electrons, as they are not as far apart as they could be. VSEPR theory predicts that atoms and electron pairs will arrange themselves in a way that minimizes this repulsion. Tetrahedral Geometry : In a tetrahedral geometry (left), the bond angles of 109.5\u00b0 are much larger than 90\u00b0, allowing for less repulsion between the bonding groups. The tetrahedral arrangement is the most stable configuration for four groups around a central atom like carbon because it maximizes the distance between the groups. The square planar arrangement in the right-hand image is not observed because it would lead to significantly greater electron repulsion, making the molecule less stable. Drawing 3D Molecular structures A solid line is used for a bond in the plane. A wedge is used for a bond in front of the plane. A dashed line is used for a bond behind the plane Equivalent reprensations for methane The molecule can be turned in many different ways, generating equivalent representations. It is a 3d structure, not matter the orientation The following drawing all represent the same thing, a methane molecule Wedges and dashed wedges are used to denote groups that are really aligned one behind another, order does not matter Non bonded pairs of electrons are counted as groups In ammonia \\(\\ce{NH3}\\) one of the four groups attached to the central N atom is a lone pair. The group geometry is a tetrahedron The molecular shape is referred to as trigonal pyramidal The 3D structure of water In water, \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) two four groups are attached to the central O atom lone pairs. The group geometry is a tetrahedron The molecular shape is referred as bent In water, the oxygen \\(\\ce{O}\\) has two bonding pairs and two lone pairs of electrons. According to VESPR theory, electron pairs around the central atom repel each other and try to maximize the distance between themselves to minimize repulsion. The oxygen atom is surrounded by four electron groups Two single bonds Two lone pairs Lone pairs exert a greater force than single bonds can do Shape is a actually bent , because the lone pairs occupy more space thus forcing the \\(\\ce{H}\\) atoms to get closer. Bringing the angle between them from an expected 109.5\u00b0 to 104.5\u00b0\u00b0 As a general note, many structures having lone pairs the bonded atoms are compressed into a smaller space with a smaller bond angle. \ud83c\udfde\ufe0f Visualizing Imagine the oxygen atom at the center of a tetrahedron. Two of the tetrahedral positions are taken by lone pairs of electrons. The other two positions are taken by the two hydrogen atoms. This gives a bent shape because the lone pairs occupy more space than the bonding pairs, causing the hydrogen atoms to be closer together. Orbitals and bonding Hydrogen When the \\(\\text{1s}\\) orbital of one H atom overlaps with the \\(\\text{1s}\\) orbital of another \\(\\ce{H}\\) atom, a sigma \\(\\sigma\\) bond concentrating e-density between the two nuclei is formed. All single bonds are also referred to as \\(\\sigma\\) bonds. The bonding is cylindrically symmetrical because the electrons forming the bond are distributed symmetrically about an imaginary line connecting the two nuclei. Methane and divalent carbon NOTE: The lowest energy arrangement of electrons for an atom is called its ground state To account for the bonding patterns observed in more complext molecules, we must take a closer look at how the second ring orbitals of atoms in the second row are being used. In addition to its two core electrons, carbon has 4 valence electrons. In its ground state , carbon places it's valence electrons in the following manner: 2 electrons in the 2s orbital one electron each in the 2p orbital According to these observations, carbon should form only two bonds because it has only two unpaired valence electrons. However, the resulting species \\(\\ce{CH2}\\) is very unstable (it wants more electrons so bad) and cannot be isolated under typical lab conditions. ( \\(\\ce{CH2}\\) would not have an octet of electrons) The term \"isolated\" refers to the ability to separate and maintain a chemical species in a pure, stable form under standard laboratory conditions. When a molecule or compound is said to be \"isolated,\" it means that it can exist on its own without rapidly reacting or decomposing, and it can be studied independently. Isolating \\(\\ce{CH2}\\) would mean that this molecule (methylene) can be separated, kept stable, and observed in a lab without breaking down or reacting with other substances. However, \\(\\ce{CH2}\\) is highly reactive because it lacks a full octet , making it very unstable. As a result, it cannot be isolated under typical conditions as it reacts almost immediately with other molecules or atoms in an attempt to achieve stability (e.g. forming more bonds to complete its octet). This inability to be isolated means that the \\(\\ce{CH2}\\) species can't be bottled or handled easily as a stable, stand-alone molecule in the lab. Seeking electrons, \\(\\ce{CH2}\\) wants to become stable by staisfying the octet rule. It does so by \\(\\text{sp}^3\\) hybridization a process in which one \\(\\text{s}\\) and 3 \\(\\text{p}\\) orbitals combine to form up a new hybrid orbital. One 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals from the same atom mix together to form four new, identical hybrid orbitals. These four hybrid orbitals are arranged in a tetrahedral geometry around the central atom, with bond angles of approximately 109.5\u00b0 between them. These hybrid orbitals overlap with the 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form four strong \\(\\sigma\\ bonds\\) , resulting in a stable tetrahedral structure. Hybridization is the combination of two or more atomic orbitals to form the same number of hybrid orbitals, each having the same shape and energy.

It is the strongest type of covalent bond and is present in all single, double, and triple bonds . \\(\\pi\\) : Formed by side-to-side overlap of unhybridized p orbitals, only found in double and triple bonds , and adds to the bond strength and rigidity. Bond types in single, double, and triple bonds: Single Bond : Composition : One \\(\\sigma\\) bond. Geometry : Allows free rotation around the bond axis (e.g., ethane, \\(\\ce{C2H6}\\) ). Double Bond : Composition : One \\(\\sigma\\) bond + one \\(\\pi\\) bond. Geometry : Planar structure with restricted rotation (e.g., ethene, \\(\\ce{C2H4}\\) ). Triple Bond : Composition : One \\(\\sigma\\) bond + two \\(\\pi\\) bonds. Geometry : Linear structure with no rotation (e.g., acetylene, \\(\\ce{C2H2}\\) ). Sigma bonds form the basic framework, while pi bonds add rigidity and prevent rotation in double and triple bonds. Bonding via \\(\\text{sp}^3\\) hybrid oribitals Each bond in \\(\\ce{CH4}\\) is formed by overlap of an \\(\\text{sp}^3\\) hybrid orbital of carbon with a \\(\\text{1s}\\) orbital from hydrogen. These four bonds point to the corners of a tetrahedron. How to determine hybridization? Count the number of groups, which are atoms and non-bonded electron pairs, around the atom. The number of groups directly corresponds to the number of atomic orbitals that must be hybridized to form the hybrid orbital.

Rotation occurs around the central \\(\\ce{C-C}\\) \\(\\sigma\\) bond. Ethylene \\(\\ce{CH2CH2}\\) 3D structure Hybridization in ethylene : Each carbon in ethylene \\(\\ce{C2H4}\\) is \\(\\text{sp}^2\\) hybridized, forming three$\\text{sp}^2 $hybrid orbitals. These orbitals participate in forming \\(\\sigma\\) bonds with hydrogen atoms and between the two carbon atoms. \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\pi\\) bonds in ethylene : The double bond in ethylene consists of one \\(\\sigma\\) bond and one \\(\\pi\\) bond. The sigma bond results from the overlap of sp\u00b2 hybrid orbitals, while the pi bond forms from the lateral overlap of unhybridized p orbitals. No free rotation in ethylene : Rotation around the \\(\\ce{C=C}\\) double bond is restricted due to the \\(\\pi\\) bond. Rotation can only happen if the pi bond is broken, which requires significant energy. \\(\\text{sp}\\) hybrid orbitals Here is a brief outline of the content from the image on sp Hybrid Orbitals : sp Hybridization in Acetylene (HC\u2261CH) : In acetylene, each carbon atom is sp hybridized . This means that each carbon has two sp hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized p orbitals (one along the py axis and one along the pz axis). Linear Geometry : The two sp hybrid orbitals are arranged linearly, resulting in a bond angle of 180\u00b0 . These orbitals form sigma (\u03c3) bonds with hydrogen atoms and between the two carbon atoms. Unhybridized p Orbitals : The two unhybridized p orbitals on each carbon atom are oriented perpendicular to the sp orbitals. These p orbitals participate in forming two pi (\u03c0) bonds, resulting in the triple bond between the carbon atoms. This configuration explains the linear structure and bond characteristics of molecules like acetylene. Acetylene \\(\\ce{C2H2}\\) 3D structure In acetylene ( \\(\\ce{HC#CH}\\) ), each carbon atom undergoes sp hybridization . This means that one s orbital and one p orbital from each carbon atom combine to form two sp hybrid orbitals. These sp orbitals are oriented linearly, giving a bond angle of 180\u00b0 , which explains the linear geometry of the molecule. Each carbon atom in acetylene also retains two unhybridized 2p orbitals . These orbitals are oriented perpendicular to each other and to the sp hybrid orbitals. The sp hybrid orbitals are used to form sigma (\u03c3) bonds : one between each carbon atom and a hydrogen atom and one between the two carbon atoms. Triple Bonds The triple bond between the two carbon atoms in acetylene consists of: - One \\(\\sigma\\) bond : This bond is formed by the head-on overlap of two sp hybrid orbitals, one from each carbon atom. - Two \\(\\pi\\) bonds : The two unhybridized 2p orbitals on each carbon atom overlap side-by-side with the corresponding 2p orbitals on the other carbon atom. These side-by-side overlaps create two pi bonds. One pi bond is formed from the overlap of the p orbitals along the y-axis , and the other from the overlap of the p orbitals along the z-axis . The result is a strong triple bond that consists of: 1. One \\(\\sigma\\) bond that aligns along the internuclear axis. 2. Two \\(\\pi\\) bonds that are perpendicular to the sigma bond and each other, giving the molecule its rigidity and preventing free rotation around the triple bond. Properties of Triple Bonds Strength : Triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double or single bonds because they involve more overlapping electron density between the bonded atoms. Bond Length : The bond length in acetylene is shorter than in compounds with double or single bonds due to the increased overlap from the \\(\\pi\\) bonds. Rigidity : The presence of two \\(\\pi\\) bonds in a triple bond restricts rotation around the bond axis, making the molecule more rigid than alkenes (with double bonds) or alkanes (with single bonds).

Bond polarity Electronegativity values are used to indicate wether the electrons in a bond are equally shared or unequally shared between two atoms. When electrons are equally shared, the bond is nonpolar Nonpolar bonds A \\(\\ce{C-C}\\) bond is nonpolar . \\(\\ce{C-H}\\) bonds are considered to be nonpolar because the electronegativity difference between \\(\\ce{C}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}\\) is small. Whenever two different atoms having similar electronegativities are bonded together, the bond is nonpolar . Polar bonds Bonding between atoms of different electronegativity values results in unequal sharing of electrons. The \\(\\ce{C-O}\\) bond In this bond electrons are pulled away from \\(\\ce{C}\\) toward \\(\\ce{O}\\) which is the element having higher electronegativity (see table above). The bond is polar, or polar covalent. The bond is said to have dipole; that is, partial separation of charge. - The \\(\\delta^+\\) means the indicated atom is electron deficient. - The \\(\\delta^-\\) means the indicated atom is electron rich. - The direction of polarity in a bond is indicated by an arrow with the head of the arrow pointing towards the more electronegative element. - The tail of the arrow is drawn at the less electronegative element. Polar molecules A polar molecule has either one polar bond, or two or more bond dipoles that reinforce each other. Example of water polarity: - It is a bent molecule - Two dipoles reinforce - It has a net dipole, making it a polar molecule Nonpolar molecules A nonpolar molecule has either no polar bonds, or two or more bond dipoles that cancel A nonpolar molecule has either no polar bonds, or two or more cancelling bond dipoles. Example of carbon dioxyde nonpolarity - It is a linear molecule - Two dipoles are equal and opposite - Two dipoles cancel out - It is a nonpolar molecule with no net dipole Essential polarity rules Rules: If the electronegativity difference ( \\(\\Delta EN\\) ) is less than 0.5, the bond is nonpolar covalent . If the \\(\\Delta EN\\) is between 0.5 and 1.6, the bond is considered polar covalent . If the \\(\\Delta EN\\) is greater than 2.0, the bond is ionic . If the \\(\\Delta EN\\) is between 1.6 and 2.0: If a metal is involved , the bond is considered ionic . If only nonmetals are involved , the bond is considered polar covalent . Example: Sodium bromide ( \\(\\ce{NaBr}\\) ; \\(\\ce{EN_{Na}} = 0.9\\) , \\(\\ce{EN_{Br}} = 2.8\\) ): \\(\\Delta EN = 1.9\\) Hydrogen fluoride ( \\(\\ce{HF}\\) ; \\(\\ce{EN_{H}} = 2.1\\) , \\(\\ce{EN_{F}} = 4.0\\) ): \\(\\Delta EN = 1.9\\) Rule 4 applies: - \\(\\ce{NaBr}\\) has ionic bonds because it involves a metal (Na). - \\(\\ce{HF}\\) has a polar covalent bond because both atoms are nonmetals. These two compounds are quite different: - \\(\\ce{NaBr}\\) exhibits the classic lattice structure typical of ionic substances. - \\(\\ce{HF}\\) is a gas at room temperature, reflecting the nature of polar covalent bonds.","title":"Organic Chemistry, Academic Year 2024/2025"},{"location":"lectures/organic-chemistry/lesson-2_19-09-2024.html#organic-chemistry-academic-year-20242025","text":"Organic Chemistry, Academic Year 2024/2025 Atomic Structure and Chemical Bonding Atomic Structure Charged ions Atomic Orbitals S Orbital P Orbitals Shells, subshells and energy levels BOHR's Atomic model Subshells shapes Orbitals and sub-orbitals (or shells and subshells) of Bound Electrons Notes on the periodic table Chemical bonding Ionic bonds Before the Transfer: After the Electron Transfer: Why Do They Have Opposite Charges?

Atomic number The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element Mass number The mass number is the number of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus The atomic weight of a particular element is the weighted average of the mass of all its isotopes reported in atomic mass unit (amu).

A bond or molecule is polar if it has such charge separation, while it is nonpolar if the electrons are evenly distributed. Polar Bonds : In a polar covalent bond , one atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the other. This creates a dipole moment , where: The atom that attracts electrons more strongly becomes slightly negative (partial negative charge, \u03b4\u2212). The other atom becomes slightly positive (partial positive charge, \u03b4+). The bond is said to be polar because there is a separation of charge, creating \"poles\" (one positive, one negative). Example : In water \\(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\\) , oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the electrons are pulled closer to oxygen, making oxygen \u03b4\u2212 and hydrogen \u03b4+.

This configuration mimics the electron arrangement of noble gases, which are naturally stable due to having a full outer shell. Second row elements can have no more that eight electrons around them. For neutral molecules, this has two consequences: Atoms with one, two, three or four valence electrons form one, two, three or four bonds, respectively in neutral molecules (e.g. \\(\\text{BF}_3\\) , \\(\\text{CH}_4\\) ) In boron trifluoride \\(\\text{BF}_3\\) , each fluorine atom shares 1 electron with boron, completing fluorine\u2019s octet and giving boron 3 shared electrons in its valence shell. Fluorine has an atomic number of 9, meaning it has 9 electrons: 2 in the first energy level and 7 in the second (valence) shell. The second shell can hold a maximum of 8 electrons, so fluorine is 1 electron short of completing its octet. Boron is one of the exceptions to the octet rule, meaning it can form stable compounds with fewer than 8 electrons in its valence shell. In \\(\\text{BF}_3\\) , boron doesn't need a full octet to be chemically stable. Atoms with 1\u20134 valence electrons form as many bonds as they have valence electrons because they only have that many electrons available to share . These atoms are \"sharing\" their valence electrons with other atoms to reach the octet rule, or 8 electrons in their outer shell. The number of bonds they can form is directly tied to the number of valence electrons they have to offer. Atoms with five or more valence electrons form enough bonds to give an octet (e.g. \\(\\text{NH}_3\\) ) In this case, the predicted number of bonds is given by = 8 - #{valence electrons} These atoms (like nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine) are already close to 8 electrons in their valence shell. Since they already have most of the electrons they need (5, 6, or 7), they are more reactive and eager to form bonds with other atoms to quickly complete their octet. Oxygen, with 6 valence electrons , needs 2 more electrons to complete its octet. It easily achieves this by forming two covalent bonds , where each bond involves sharing one pair of electrons with another atom, allowing oxygen to reach the stable 8-electron configuration.

Place a bond between every two atoms, giving two electrons to each H and no more than eight to any second row atom. For each bond between atoms, place a single line (representing a pair of shared electrons). Each hydrogen (H) should receive two electrons (a single bond), while atoms in the second row of the periodic table (like carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen) should not exceed eight electrons (the octet rule). Use all remaining electrons to fill octets with lone pairs. After placing bonds, assign any remaining electrons as lone pairs on the atoms to complete their octet.

Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory : The theory states that the electron pairs (bonding pairs and lone pairs) surrounding an atom will position themselves as far apart as possible to minimize repulsion.

Isolating \\(\\ce{CH2}\\) would mean that this molecule (methylene) can be separated, kept stable, and observed in a lab without breaking down or reacting with other substances. However, \\(\\ce{CH2}\\) is highly reactive because it lacks a full octet , making it very unstable. As a result, it cannot be isolated under typical conditions as it reacts almost immediately with other molecules or atoms in an attempt to achieve stability (e.g. forming more bonds to complete its octet). This inability to be isolated means that the \\(\\ce{CH2}\\) species can't be bottled or handled easily as a stable, stand-alone molecule in the lab. Seeking electrons, \\(\\ce{CH2}\\) wants to become stable by staisfying the octet rule. It does so by \\(\\text{sp}^3\\) hybridization a process in which one \\(\\text{s}\\) and 3 \\(\\text{p}\\) orbitals combine to form up a new hybrid orbital. One 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals from the same atom mix together to form four new, identical hybrid orbitals. These four hybrid orbitals are arranged in a tetrahedral geometry around the central atom, with bond angles of approximately 109.5\u00b0 between them. These hybrid orbitals overlap with the 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form four strong \\(\\sigma\\ bonds\\) , resulting in a stable tetrahedral structure. Hybridization is the combination of two or more atomic orbitals to form the same number of hybrid orbitals, each having the same shape and energy.

Lone pairs and \\(\\pi\\) bonds (in blue above) make morphine a base. The image is quite strange, so here is a 3D representation which will hopefully make this easier to visualize: Pubmed Morphine 3D Reactions of Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids and bases A Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid base reaction results in the transfer of a proton from an acid to a base The electron pair of the base \\(\\ce{B:}\\) forms a new bond to the proton of the acid The acid \\(\\ce{H-A}\\) loses a proton, leaving the electron pair in the \\(\\ce{H-A}\\) bond on \\(\\ce{A}\\) . This forms the conjugate base of the acid. The double reaction arrow notation (equilibrium) is used between starting materials and products to indicate that the reaction can proceed in both directions. A conjugate base is what remains of the acidic part that was altered after losing it's proton Similalrly, a conjugate acid is what you obtain by bonding the lost proton the the basic compound, (simply, it is formed when the base gains a proton). Acid \\(\\text{HA}\\) donates a proton, forming: $$ \\text{HA} \\rightarrow \\text{H}^+ + \\text{A}^- $$ \\(\\text{HA}\\) is the acid , and \\(\\text{A}^-\\) is the conjugate base . Base \\(\\text{B}\\) accepts a proton, forming: $$ \\text{B} + \\text{H}^+ \\rightarrow \\text{BH}^+ $$ \\(\\text{B}\\) is the base , and \\(\\text{BH}^+\\) is the conjugate acid . In reactions, the movement of electrons can be illustrated using curved arrow notation. Because two electron pairs are involved in this reaction below two arrows are needed. When \\(\\ce{NH2^-}\\) reacts with \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) , the amide ion will abstract a proton proton \\(\\ce{H^+}\\) from water. The proton (H\u207a) from water, which is accepted by the nitrogen in ammonia. What actually happens The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen in \\(\\ce{NH2^-}\\) is used to form a bond with the proton ( \\(\\ce{H^+}\\) ) from water. The nitrogen in the amide ion ( \\(\\ce{NH2^-}\\) ) now shares its lone pair with the proton ( \\(\\ce{H^+}\\) ), resulting in the formation of a new \\(\\ce{N-H}\\) bond. This forms \\(\\ce{NH3}\\) (ammonia). The lone pair of electrons from nitrogen is now shared with the hydrogen atom ( \\(\\ce{H^+}\\) ) to form the new N-H bond in ammonia ( \\(\\ce{NH3}\\) ). As water donates a proton, it is left as \\(\\ce{OH^-}\\) (hydroxide ion). As water donates its proton ( \\(\\ce{H^+}\\) ), it leaves behind its electron (which was part of the \\(\\ce{O-H}\\) bond). This electron remains on the oxygen, forming the hydroxide ion ( \\(\\ce{OH^-}\\) ). The nitrogen in \\(\\ce{NH2^-}\\) becomes neutral , and water becomes \\(\\ce{OH^-}\\) after losing its proton. General rules of reactivity Electron-rich species react with electron-deficient species Bases are electron rich Acids are electron deficient; the \\(\\ce{H}\\) of an acid has a partial positive charge Therefore, acids and bases react with one another Acid strength and \\(\\text{pK}_a\\) Acid strength is the tendency of an acid to donate a proton. The more readily a compound donates a proton, the stronger an acid is. Why water acts as a base in this reaction In this particular case, H-A is a stronger acid than water. Water, with its lone pair of electrons on oxygen, can accept a proton, acting as a base. The proton (H\u207a) is transferred from H-A to water, forming the hydronium ion ( \\(\\ce{H3O^+}\\) ) and the conjugate base ( \\(\\ce{A^-}\\) ). NOTE : This ability of being both an acid or a base depending on the context is known as being amphoteric . In the example from the image, water is acting as a base , but it can also act as an acid in other situations. What is a solvent? A solvent is a substance that dissolves other substances (called solutes) to form a solution. Water ( \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) ) is a very common solvent in many chemical reactions, including acid-base reactions, due to its polarity and ability to dissolve many substances. In the reaction above between an acid ( \\(\\ce{H-A}\\) ) and water in the image, water is acting as the solvent because it provides the medium in which the reaction occurs. IT DOESN\u2019T NECESSARILY PARTICIPATE IN THE CHEMICAL REACTION AS A REACTANT (though sometimes it does, like water in this case). Acid-Base equilibrium Acidity is measured by an equilibrium constant When a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid \\(\\ce{H-A}\\) is dissolved in water, an acid base reaction occurs and an equilibrium constant can be written for the reaction. \\[ K_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{[\\text{products}]}{[\\text{starting materials}]} = \\frac{[\\ce{H3O^+}][\\ce{A^-}]}{[\\ce{HA}][\\ce{H2O}]} \\] Acidity constant The concentration of the solvent \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) is essentially constant, so the equation can be rearranged and a new equilibrium constant, called the acidity contant \\(\\text{K}_a\\) is defined \\[ K*a = [\\ce{H2O}] K*{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{[\\ce{H3O^+}][\\ce{A^-}]}{[\\ce{HA}]} \\] The square brackets \\(\\text{[ <mol> ]}\\) in chemical equations represent the concentration of a substance, typically in moles per liter (M) or mol/L. This notation is used to express how much of a substance is present in a given volume of solution. It is generally more convenient when describing acid strength to use \\(\\text{pK}_a\\) values than \\(\\text{K}_a\\) values. \\[ \\text{p}K_a = -\\log K_a \\] \\(\\text{K}_a\\) of typical organic acids \\(\\text{K}_a\\) of typical organic acids \\(\\text{10}^{-5} \\rightarrow \\text{10}^{-50}\\) \\(\\text{+5} \\rightarrow \\text{+50}\\) Larger number, stronger acid Smaller number, stronger acid Smaller number, weaker acid Larger number, weaker acid The smaller the \\(\\text{pK}_a\\) , the stronger the acid.

Steps into solving acid-base reactions equilibria Step 1 : Identify the base in the starting materials. Assume \\(\\ce{-NH2}\\) the base because it bears a net negative charge. That makes \\(\\ce{HC#CH}\\) (acetylene) the acid. Step 2 : Draw the products of proton transfer and identify the conjugate acid and base in the products. Acetylene gives up its proton to \\(\\ce{-NH2}\\) Step 3 : Compare the \\(\\text{pK}_a\\) values of the acid and the conjugate acid.Equilibrium favors the formation of the weaker acid with the higher \\(\\text{pK}_a\\) value. The \\(\\text{pK}_a\\) of \\(\\text{NH3}\\) is higher, therefore products are favored. Factors that determine acid strength NOTE : Anything that stabilizes a conjugate base \\(\\ce{(A:)^-}\\) make the starting acid \\(\\ce{H-A}\\) more acidic. Four factors affect the acidity of \\(\\ce{H-A}\\) . These are the following: Element Effects : The identity of the atom directly bonded to the acidic hydrogen significantly affects acidity. Across a period (left to right), electronegativity increases, so a more electronegative atom stabilizes the negative charge on A\u207b better, leading to a stronger acid. Down a group, the size of the atom increases, and larger atoms can better accommodate the negative charge, also making the acid stronger. Inductive Effects : Electronegative atoms or groups attached to the molecule can withdraw electron density through sigma bonds (induction), helping to stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base. This effect decreases with distance from the acidic site, but the presence of electronegative atoms like fluorine can still increase acidity by stabilizing the conjugate base. Resonance Effects : If the conjugate base \\(\\ce{A^-}\\) has resonance structures that delocalize the negative charge over multiple atoms, the conjugate base is more stable, which increases the acidity of the starting acid. For example, carboxylic acids are more acidic than alcohols because the conjugate base (carboxylate) is stabilized by resonance. Hybridization Effects : The hybridization of the atom bonded to the acidic hydrogen affects acidity. More s-character in the hybrid orbitals increases acidity because a higher s-character means the electrons are held closer to the nucleus, stabilizing the negative charge on the conjugate base. For example, \\(\\text{sp}\\) -hybridized carbon (as in alkynes) is more acidic than \\(\\text{sp}^2\\) (alkenes) or \\(\\text{sp}^3\\) (alkanes) hybridized carbon. Note on stability The more stable the conjugate base, the more easily the acid can lose its proton, and therefore, the stronger the acid. Some keynotes includes Always draw the conjugate bases Determine which conjugate base is more stable The more stable the conjugate base, the more acidic the acid Element effects - Trends in the periodic table Why does H2O have a much lower pKa than CH4? Easy \\(\\Rightarrow\\) since oxygen is much more electronegative than carbon, it more readily accepts a negative charge. Yes, across a row of the periodic table, the acidity of H\u2013A increases as the electronegativity of the atom A increases. This trend occurs because more electronegative atoms stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base (A\u207b) better after the acid (H\u2013A) donates a proton (H\u207a). A more stable conjugate base makes it easier for the acid to lose its proton, thus increasing the acidity. Trend of electronegativity across a period As you move from left to right across a row of the periodic table, the electronegativity of the atoms increases. This is due to the following reasons: Increasing nuclear charge : As the atomic number increases across a period, the number of protons in the nucleus also increases. This pulls the electrons more strongly towards the nucleus, increasing electronegativity. Smaller atomic radius : Moving from left to right across a period also leads to a decrease in atomic radius (since electrons are added to the same shell but the nucleus pulls them closer), which further enhances the atom's ability to attract electrons. Notes on electronegativity Electronegativity values are often reported using the Pauling scale , named after Linus Pauling . General electronegativity trends on the periodic table The most electronegative elements are found at the top right of the periodic table (excluding the noble gases), with fluorine being the most electronegative element. Metals on the left side of the periodic table (like sodium, potassium) have very low electronegativity because they tend to lose electrons easily. How electronegativity relates to acidity As electronegativity of A increases , the ability of A to stabilize the negative charge on A\u207b increases after the loss of a proton. This makes the acid (H\u2013A) stronger. For example, across the period from C (in CH\u2084) to N (in NH\u2083) to O (in H\u2082O) to F (in HF), the acidity of H\u2013A increases dramatically because the conjugate bases become more stabilized due to the increasing electronegativity of A. A little side note on calculating electronegativity Pauling's approach : Pauling calculated electronegativity using bond dissociation energies between different atoms. Moreover, the difference in electronegativity between two atoms can be inferred from the bond energy difference between a heteronuclear bond (A\u2013B) and the average of the homonuclear bonds (A\u2013A and B\u2013B). $$ | \\chi_A - \\chi_B | \\propto \\text{(Bond energy of A\u2013B)} - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\text{Bond energy of A\u2013A} + \\text{Bond energy of B\u2013B} \\right) $$ NOTE : \\(\\chi\\) (chi) is used as the symbol for electronegatity Trend of electronegativity down a column Down a column of the periodic table , the size of the atom becomes the dominant factor in determining acidity, not electronegativity. Larger atoms can better stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base because the charge is spread over a greater volume. Charge stabilization : Positive or negative charge is more stable when it is spread over a larger area or volume. For larger atoms, the negative charge on the conjugate base is distributed over a greater space, reducing charge density and making the conjugate base more stable. Inductive effects An inductive effect is the pull of electron density through \\(\\sigma\\) bonds caused by electronegativity differences of atoms. More electronegative atoms stabilize regions of high electron density by an electron withdrawing inductive effect, basically pulling electrons closer to them. The more electronegative the atom and the closer it is to the site of the negative charge \\(\\Rightarrow\\) the greater the effect. The acidity of \\(\\ce{H-A}\\) increases with the presence of electron withdrawing groups in A. Inductive effects on Trifluoroethanol Note that 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol is more acidic than ethanol. \\(\\Rightarrow\\) This is because the three electronegative fluorine atoms stabilize the negatively charged conjugate base. REMEMBER : the conjugate base is what remains of the initial acid after the reaction took place \\(\\ce{CF3}\\) is polarized creating a pulling force towards its center from the methylene group, ultimately making the alcohol tail more prone to give away it's proton. This is the reason why trifluoroethanol is more acidic than plain ethanol. Resonance effects Delocalization of charge through resonance influences acidity. Acetic acid is more acidic than ethanol, even though both conjugate bases have the negative charge on the same element, \\(\\ce{O}\\) . Acetic Acid \\(\\ce{CH3COOH}\\) : When acetic acid donates a proton (H\u207a), it forms the acetate ion \\(\\ce{CH3COO^-}\\) as its conjugate base. The negative charge on the oxygen in the acetate ion is delocalized through resonance . There are two resonance structures in which the negative charge is shared equally between the two oxygen atoms. $$ \\ce{CH3-C(=O)O^-} \\leftrightarrow \\ce{CH3-C(O^-)O} $$ This delocalization of the negative charge over both oxygen atoms stabilizes the conjugate base (acetate ion) significantly. Ethanol \\(\\ce{CH3CH2OH}\\) : When ethanol loses a proton, it forms the ethoxide ion \\(\\ce{CH3CH2O^\u207b}\\) as its conjugate base. In this case, the negative charge is localized entirely on one oxygen atom because no resonance is possible. Structure of ethoxide ion: $$ \\ce{CH3CH2O^-} $$ The negative charge is concentrated on a single oxygen atom, making the ethoxide ion less stable compared to the acetate ion. In acetic acid , the negative charge on the conjugate base is delocalized between two oxygen atoms through resonance, greatly stabilizing the conjugate base. In ethanol , the negative charge on the conjugate base is localized on a single oxygen atom, making the ethoxide ion less stable. Hybridization effects Consider the relative acidities of three different compounds containing \\(\\text{C-H}\\) bonds Why higher s-character means more stability The closer the electrons are to the nucleus, the less reactive they become because they are more shielded from external forces. This stabilizes the negative charge, making the conjugate base more stable. A more stable conjugate base (where the negative charge is well stabilized) means that the original acid can more easily donate its proton, because the resulting negative charge won't cause as much instability.

Do electron-withdrawing groups stabilize the conjugate base? Is the conjugate base resonance stabilized? How is the conjugate base hybridized? The familiar acids \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) and \\(\\ce{H2SO4}\\) are often used in organic reactions. Various organic acids are also commonly used (e.g., acetic acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid \\(\\ce{TsOH}\\) ). Here also a list of commonly used bases in organic chemistry, mostly negatively charged bases. Characteristics of strong organic bases Strong bases have weak conjugate acids with high \\(\\text{pKa}\\) values, usually \\(\\text{> 12}\\) . Strong bases have a net negative charge, but not all negatively charged species are strong bases. For example, none of the halides \\(\\ce{Fe^-}\\) , \\(\\ce{Cl^-}\\) , \\(\\ce{Br^-}\\) or \\(\\ce{I^-}\\) is a strong base. Carbanions, negatively charged carbon atoms, are especially strong bases. A common example is butyllithium \\[ \\ce{CH3CH2CH2{\\ddot{\\ C^-}}H2 Li+} \\] Other common bases in orhanic chemistry Amines are organic bases; due to having a lone pair on the \\(\\ce{N}\\) atom Amines are organic compounds and functional groups that contain nitrogen atom bonded to one or more carbon-containing group (alkyl or aryl): derivatives of ammonia \\(\\ce{NH3}\\) where one or more \\(\\ce{H}\\) was replaced by carbon-based groups They are weaker, since they have a neutral charge unlike stronger bases having a negative net charge Triehtylamine Pyridine Aspirin Aspirin is a well known drug (acetylsalicylic acid), it functions as analgesic, anti-pyretic and anti-inflammatory agent. In ionic form , it is soluble in the aqueous blood stream and transported to tissues where it is needed. When protonated, it becomes netrual and can pass through cell membranes to ihnibit certain chemical reactions. Lewis bases NOTE : lewis definitions are simpler as they only consider describing reactions as a mean of electrons transfer. A lewis base is an electron pair donor. Lewis bases are structurally the same as Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry bases. Both have an available electron pair: - A lone pair - An electron pair in a \\(\\pi\\) bond - The \\(\\pi\\) bonds have electron density above and below the axis connecting the nuclei of the bonded atoms. These electrons in the \\(\\pi\\) bond are less tightly held than those in a \\(\\sigma\\) bond, making them more reactive and available for donation in chemical reactions. A Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry base always donates an electron pair to a proton, but a Lewis base donates it to anything that is electron deficient . Generally, this rule is applied \\[ \\text{Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry base} \\Rightarrow \\text{Lewis base} \\] but not the opposite \\[ \\text{Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry base} \\space \\cancel{\\Leftarrow} \\space \\text{Lewis base} \\] Being a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry base implies being a Lewis base, but this does not hold true for the opposite. This is because a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry specifically involves a proton transfer. Specifically, they accept a proton . Lewis acids A lewis acid is an electron pair acceptor \\(\\Rightarrow\\) any species that is electron deficient and capable of accepting an electron pair is also a Lewis acid . Just like before, being a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid implies being a Lewis acid, but the opposite is not necessarily true. Thus: \\[ \\text{Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid} \\Rightarrow \\text{Lewis acid} \\] \\[ \\text{Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid} \\space \\cancel{\\Leftarrow} \\space \\text{Lewis acid} \\] Common Lewis acids contain elements from the Group 3A because they do NOT posses a filled valence shell. Lewis acids and bases examples Lewis acid-base reactions In a Lewis acid-base reaction, a Lewis base donates an electron pair to a Lewis acid. NOTE : boron is electro deficient, it really wants that pair of electrons. For example, in the reaction of \\(\\ce{BF3}\\) (Boron Trifluoride) with \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) , the latter donates an electron pair to \\(\\ce{BF3}\\) to form a new bond. Creating a polarity in the \\(\\sigma\\) bond leaving the exygen slight \\(\\text{+}\\) and the Boron slightly \\(\\ce{-}\\) having gained one extra electron. Great observation! The negative charge on boron in the image represents the formal charge after the formation of the coordinate covalent bond with the oxygen from water. Reaction with Water : Water, acting as a Lewis base, donates a lone pair from the oxygen to boron. This forms a coordinate covalent bond , where both electrons in the bond come from oxygen. Formal Charge in Boron after the reaction : The formal charge on an atom can be calculated using this formula: $$ \\text{Formal charge} = \\text{Valence electrons} - \\left(\\frac{\\text{bonding electrons}}{2} + \\text{non-bonding electrons}\\right) $$ Boron has 3 valence electrons (group 13 element). Bonding electrons include all those that are part of a bond, e.g. each single bond with Fluorine contributes with two electrons as well as the bond with oxygen. $$ \\text{Formal charge on boron} = 3 - \\left(\\frac{8}{2} + 0\\right) = 3 - 4 = -1 $$ Thus, boron gains a formal negative charge of (-1) because it is now \"assigned\" one more electron than it originally had in its neutral state. NOTE : This does not mean that boron is negatively charged in the sense of gaining an actual electron, but rather that in the context of formal charges, it has \"access\" to one more electron than expected based on its original number of valence electrons. The vacancy in the unhybridized p orbital is crucial to understanding why \\(\\ce{BF3}\\) is a Lewis acid. Because boron is electron-deficient, it can accept a pair of electrons into this empty p orbital. Elecrophiles and Nuclephiles The general pattern of Lewis acid-base reaction is about electron-rich species interating with electron-poor ones. A lewis acid is also called an electrophile . When a lewis base interacts with an electrophile that is not a proton, the base is called a nucleophile . \\(\\ce{BF3} \\rightarrow\\) electrophile \\(\\ce{H2O} \\rightarrow\\) nucleophile Lewis acid-base reations forming a new covalent bond The electron pair from the Lewis base is used to form a new covalent bond with the Lewis acid, and this results in the formation of a Lewis acid-base complex . In some Lewis acid-base reactions, one bond is formed and one bond is broken . Identify the Lewis acid and base first. The Lewis acid is the electron pair acceptor (usually electron-deficient). The Lewis base is the electron pair donor (usually with a lone pair of electrons). Draw a curved arrow from the electron pair of the base to the electron-deficient atom of the acid. This arrow shows the movement of electrons from the base to the acid, forming a new bond. Count electron pairs and break a bond when needed to keep the correct number of valence electrons. In reactions where a bond must be broken to avoid exceeding the octet rule, ensure you adjust the bonding and lone pairs accordingly. Alkene- \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) reaction The reaction between cyclohexene and HCl can be treated as a Lewis acid-base interaction. \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) acts as the Lewis acid, and cyclohexene (having a \\(\\pi\\) bond) is the Lewis base . The electron pair in the \\(\\pi\\) bond of the Lewis base forms a new bond to the proton of the Lewis acid, generating a carbocation. The \\(\\ce{H-Cl}\\) bond must break, giving its two electrons to \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) , forming \\(\\ce{Cl^-}\\) . Because two electron pairs are involved two curved arrows are used below. Why does cyclohexene break its double bond? Cyclohexene breaks its double bond during the reaction with HCl because the \u03c0 bond electrons are loosely held and reactive, not because cyclohexene is electron-deficient to begin with. The reason for the double bond breaking lies in the reactivity of the \u03c0 bond in the presence of an electrophile. NOTE : in the reaction of cyclohexene with \\(\\ce{HCl}\\) , the single bond with the proton could happen at any of the two ends of the double bond since the result would be the same. Why does Chlorine does not follow the hydrogen in the bonding? Chlorine does not follow hydrogen in the bonding because it is highly electronegative and prefers to keep the electrons for itself. When cyclohexene donates electrons to the proton ( H\u207a ), the H-Cl bond polarizes further , pulling the bonding electrons towards chlorine. Since chlorine is already stable as Cl\u207b (with a full octet), it rejects further bonding and releases the proton, breaking the bond.","title":"Organic Chemistry, Academic Year 2024/2025"},{"location":"lectures/organic-chemistry/lesson-3_20-09-2024.html#organic-chemistry-academic-year-20242025","text":"Organic Chemistry, Academic Year 2024/2025 Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry Acids and Bases, Lewis Acids and Bases What is an acid?

Inductive Effects : Electronegative atoms or groups attached to the molecule can withdraw electron density through sigma bonds (induction), helping to stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base. This effect decreases with distance from the acidic site, but the presence of electronegative atoms like fluorine can still increase acidity by stabilizing the conjugate base. Resonance Effects : If the conjugate base \\(\\ce{A^-}\\) has resonance structures that delocalize the negative charge over multiple atoms, the conjugate base is more stable, which increases the acidity of the starting acid. For example, carboxylic acids are more acidic than alcohols because the conjugate base (carboxylate) is stabilized by resonance. Hybridization Effects : The hybridization of the atom bonded to the acidic hydrogen affects acidity. More s-character in the hybrid orbitals increases acidity because a higher s-character means the electrons are held closer to the nucleus, stabilizing the negative charge on the conjugate base. For example, \\(\\text{sp}\\) -hybridized carbon (as in alkynes) is more acidic than \\(\\text{sp}^2\\) (alkenes) or \\(\\text{sp}^3\\) (alkanes) hybridized carbon.

Ethanol Compounds containing an \\(\\ce{HO}\\) group are called alcohols . The hydroxy group makes the properties of ethanol very different from the properties of ethane. Ethanol has lone pairs and polar bonds that make it reactive. Other molecules with hydroxy groups will have similar properties to ethanol. NOTE : The term \"backbone\" is used to describe the continuous chain of atoms that provides the main structure, to which other atoms or groups can be attached, influencing the molecule\u2019s properties. Ethane consists of nonpolar \\(\\ce{C-C}\\) and weakly polar \\(\\ce{C-H}\\) bonds , resulting in no significant reactive sites. It lacks functional groups and lone pairs, making it chemically inert under normal conditions and requiring high energy (e.g., combustion) to break its bonds. On the other hand, Ethanol has a hydroxyl group ( \\(\\ce{-OH}\\) ) , making it much more reactive than ethane. The polar \\(\\ce{O-H}\\) and \\(\\ce{C-O}\\) bonds create partial charges, making the molecule susceptible to nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks .

When a halogen forms a bond with another element, particularly carbon, the resulting compound is called a halide . Halides (e.g., alkyl halides) have polar carbon-halogen bonds due to the high electronegativity of halogens, making them reactive in organic chemical reactions like substitution and elimination.

Amines and amides are classified by the number of carbon atoms bonded to the nitrogen atom; a 1\u00b0 amine has one C\u2013N bond, and so forth. Why all this fuss? SIGH... Notations! Carbon atoms are classified by the number of other carbon atoms they are bonded to: primary (1\u00b0) carbons are connected to one other carbon, secondary (2\u00b0) to two, tertiary (3\u00b0) to three, and quaternary (4\u00b0) to four. This helps in understanding molecular structure and reactivity. Similarly, hydrogen atoms are classified based on the type of carbon they are attached to. Functional groups like alcohols and alkyl halides are also categorized by the carbon they are bonded to, influencing their chemical behavior. Amines and amides are classified by the number of carbon atoms attached to the nitrogen, with primary (1\u00b0), secondary (2\u00b0), and tertiary (3\u00b0) amines or amides having one, two, or three carbon-nitrogen bonds, respectively. These classifications are key to predicting structure and reactivity in organic compounds. This type of classification is pretty much just precise notation allows that chemists to describe molecules better, predict their reactivity, and understand how different structural features influence their chemical behavior. Why functional groups matter A functional group in an organic compound plays a crucial role in determining its chemical and physical behavior. These characteristics can be outlined as follows: Bonding and Shape : The functional group influences the type of bonding (such as single, double, or triple bonds) and the molecular geometry, which affects how molecules interact with one another and fit into reaction mechanisms. Type and Strength of Intermolecular Forces : The functional group dictates the type of intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, or dipole-dipole interactions. These forces influence properties like boiling and melting points. Chemical and Physical Properties : The presence of a functional group affects properties such as solubility, acidity or basicity, and volatility, directly shaping the compound's behavior in different environments. Nomenclature : Functional groups also determine the naming of organic compounds, as they are often used as the basis for the systematic naming (IUPAC) of molecules. Chemical Reactivity : Functional groups govern how molecules react with other substances, dictating the types of reactions they undergo, their reaction mechanisms, and their overall reactivity in organic synthesis. These aspects help chemists predict how molecules behave and interact based on their functional groups. What are intermolecular forces? Intermolecular forces are interactions that exist between molecules, functional groups determine the type and strength of these interactions. For a figurative sense, ionic and covalent compounds have very different intermolecular interactions: Ion-Ion interactions In an ionic compound, such as sodium chloride \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\) , the positively charged sodium ions \\(\\ce{Na}^+\\) and negatively charged chloride ions \\(\\ce{Cl}^-\\) are arranged in a repeating lattice structure. The ions are held together by the electrostatic forces of attraction between opposite charges. Sidenote : This strong interaction is responsible for the high melting and boiling points of ionic compounds because a significant amount of energy is required to break these strong bonds. Ion-ion interactions are among the strongest types of attractive forces in chemistry because they involve full charges and lead to the stable, rigid structures seen in many ionic solids. This is what gives ionic compounds distinct physical properties, like hardness and high thermal stability. This image describes ion-ion interactions , which are the strong electrostatic attractions that occur between oppositely charged ions in ionic compounds. These interactions are a type of intermolecular force but are much stronger than the forces found between covalent molecules. The image also highlights that ion-ion interactions are much stronger than the intermolecular forces present in covalent molecules, such as van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonding . - In covalent compounds, the molecules themselves are neutral or only slightly polar, so the interactions between them are weaker compared to the full charges found in ionic compounds. Intermolecular forces in covalent molecules Covalent compunds are composed of discrete molecules, the natures of the forces between molecules dependes on the functional group(s) present. There are generally four types of interactions, we'll list them in order of increasing strength: - van der Waals or dispersive forces - dipole-dipole interactions - hydrogen bonding - ionic interactions van der Waals forces Van der Waals forces, also known as London dispersion forces , are the weakest type of intermolecular forces. These forces arise due to temporary fluctuations in electron density within a molecule, which create instantaneous dipoles . Even in nonpolar molecules where there is no permanent dipole, the random movement of electrons can momentarily cause a slight imbalance in charge distribution. This temporary dipole can induce a corresponding dipole in a neighboring molecule, leading to an induced dipole-induced dipole interaction . While van der Waals forces are weak, they are significant in large numbers . These forces are especially important in nonpolar compounds, where no permanent dipoles exist to generate stronger interactions like hydrogen bonds or dipole-dipole forces. The strength of van der Waals forces increases with the size and surface area of the molecule because larger molecules have more electrons and a greater ability to become polarized. NOTE : This is why larger nonpolar molecules like iodine \\(\\ce{I_2}\\) or long-chain hydrocarbons have higher boiling and melting points compared to smaller nonpolar molecules like helium \\(\\ce{He}\\) or methane ( \\(\\ce{CH_4}\\) ). var der Waals forces in methane \\(\\ce{CH_4}\\) has no net dipole At any one instant, its electron density may not be completely symmetrical, resulting in a temporary dipole. This can induce a temporary dipole in another molecule. var der Waals forces in relation with surface area All compunds exhibit van der Waals forces \\(\\rightarrow\\) The larger the surface area of a molcules, the larger the attractive forces between two molecules, and the stronger the intermolecular forces. var der Waals forces and polarizability Polarizability refers to how easily the electron cloud around an atom can be distorted by external forces. Larger atoms, with more loosely held valence electrons , are more polarizable than smaller atoms. This means that compounds with larger, more polarizable atoms experience stronger van der Waals forces compared to compounds with smaller, less polarizable atoms. Polarizability increases in larger atoms because their valence electrons are farther from the nucleus, meaning they experience a weaker attraction to the positively charged nucleus. This weaker attraction allows the electron cloud to be more easily distorted or shifted when subjected to external forces , such as the presence of a nearby dipole or temporary charge fluctuation \\(\\rightarrow\\) it is more malleable. Instead in smaller atoms, the valence electrons are closer to the nucleus and more tightly held, making them less susceptible to such distortions. Dipole-Dipole interactions Dipole-Dipole interactions are the attractive forces between the permanent dipoles of two polar molecules. The dipoles in adjacent molecules align so that the partial positive and partial negative charges are in close proximity. NOTE : These attractive forces caused by permanent dipoles are much stronger than weak van der Waals forces Intermolecular non-covalent bonding forces Dipole-dipole interactions can occur when both the drug and the binding site have permanent dipole moments. As the drug approaches the binding site, the dipoles of the drug and the binding site align with each other. This alignment helps the drug orient itself correctly within the binding site. This orientation is beneficial if it allows other functional groups on the drug to interact with the corresponding regions of the binding site effectively, enhancing the binding strength. However, if the dipoles align but the other binding groups on the drug are not positioned correctly , this orientation can be detrimental , reducing the effectiveness of the interaction. The strength of dipole-dipole interactions decreases with distance between the drug and the binding site, but it diminishes less quickly than weaker forces like van der Waals interactions. However, it still fades faster than stronger electrostatic (ionic) interactions. What really is a drug this context? In this context, the \"drug\" refers to a small molecule that is designed or naturally occurs to bind to a specific target site in the body, often a protein (such as an enzyme or receptor). The drug\u2019s goal is to interact with this target site to produce a therapeutic effect, such as inhibiting an enzyme, activating a receptor, or blocking a signaling pathway Hydrogen bonding Hydrogen bonding typically occurs when a hydrogen atom bonded to O, N, or F, is electrostatically attracted to a lone pair of electrons on an O, N, or F atom in another molecule. They vary in strength between \\(\\text{5-25 kJ/mol}\\) and are weaker than electrostatic interactions but definetely stronger than van der Waals interactions. Hydrogen bonds take place between an electron deficient hydrogen and an electron rich heteroatom (typically \\(\\ce{N}\\) or \\(\\ce{O}\\) ). The electron deficient hydrogen is called a hydrogen bond donor \\(\\rightarrow\\) HBD . The electron rich heteroatom on the other hand is called a hydrogen bond acceptor \\(\\rightarrow\\) HBA . \\(\\ce{X-H}\\) is a hydrogen bond donor (HBD), with the hydrogen being \\(\\delta^+\\) . \\(\\ce{Y}\\) is a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), with lone pairs of electrons \\(\\delta^-\\) to form hydrogen bonds. Typically, the acceptor is also an electronegative atom like oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine. In this mechanism, a drug molecule may contain such donor or acceptor groups to interact with the target via hydrogen bonding. This interaction allows the drug to bind specifically to the target, which could be a protein, enzyme, or another biological macromolecule, thereby influencing the function of the target. In hydrogen bonds the inteaction involves orbitals and is directional , optimum orientation is where the \\(\\ce{X-H}\\) bond points directly to the lone pair on \\(\\ce{Y}\\) such that the angle between X, H and Y is \\(\\ce{180\u00b0}\\) Typical H-Bond donors and Acceptors in eeceptor-proteins Donors Shared (Both Donors and Acceptors) Acceptors Peptide-NH Tyr (Tyrosine) Peptide-CO N-term. -NH\u2083\u207a Ser (Serine) C-term. -COO\u207b Lys (Lysine) Thr (Threonine) Glu (Glutamate) Arg (Arginine) His (Histidine) Asp (Aspartate) Trp (Tryptophan) Cys (Cysteine) Met (Methionine) (Weak) Asn (Asparagine) S-S Bond Gln (Glutamine) What is a receptor protein? Receptor proteins are specialized proteins located on the surface of cells (membrane receptors) or within cells (intracellular receptors) that bind to specific molecules, such as hormones, neurotransmitters, or drugs. Intermolecular non-covalent bonding forces; aka Electrostatic or ionic bond This is the strongest of the intermolecular type of bonds reaching energy levels in the range of \\(\\text{20-40 kJ/mol}\\) . This kind of interaction takes place between groups of opposite charge. The strength of the interaction is inversely proprtional to the distance of the two interactants: \\[ \\text{distance between molecules} \\propto \\text{bond strength} \\] where \\(\\propto\\) denotes inverse proportionality. Stronger interactions occur in hydrophobic environments The strength of interactions drops off less rapidly with distance than with other forms of intermolecular interactions NOTE : Ionic bonds are the most important initial interactions as a drug enters the binding site Ionic bonds are the strongest non-covalent interactions, typically ranging from \\(\\text{20-40 kJ/mol}\\) , because they involve full charges. This makes them much stronger than hydrogen bonds or van der Waals forces, which rely on partial or temporary charges. Unlike other interactions, the strength of ionic bonds decreases less rapidly with distance, meaning they remain effective over larger distances. Additionally, in hydrophobic environments where water can't interfere, ionic bonds become even stronger, playing a crucial role in stabilizing interactions in biological systems. Here is the information from the image formatted in Markdown: Essence of intermolecular forces As the polarity of an organic molecule increases, so does the strength of its intermolecular forces. Type of Force Relative Strength Exhibited by Example van der Waals weak all molecules \\(\\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3}\\) dipole\u2013dipole moderate molecules with a net dipole \\(\\ce{CH3CH2CH2CHO}\\) hydrogen bonding strong molecules with an O\u2013H, N\u2013H, or H\u2013F bond \\(\\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2OH}\\) ion\u2013ion very strong ionic compounds, groups of opposite charge in covalent molecules \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\) , \\(\\ce{LiF}\\) Physical properties Boiling point The boiling point of a compund is referred to as the temperature at which liquid molecules are converted into gas. In boiling, energy is needed in order to overcome the attractive forces in the more ordered liquid state. - The stronger the intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point. - A good example is water: it's high boiling point is due to its extensive hydrogen bonding network , which requires a significant amount of energy to break. This is why water boils at a much higher temperature than many other small molecules. The relative strength of the intermolecular forces increases from pentane to butanal to 1-butanol. The boiling points of these compounds increase in the same order. Other factors contributing to the boiling point value Surface Area : A larger surface area allows for greater intermolecular contact , which increases the strength of van der Waals forces between molecules. For example, pentan-3-one has a larger surface area than acetone , which results in stronger intermolecular forces and a higher boiling point (102\u00b0C for pentan-3-one vs. 56\u00b0C for acetone). Polarizability : Polarizability refers to how easily the electron cloud around an atom can be distorted. - Larger atoms with more diffuse electron clouds are more polarizable , leading to stronger van der Waals forces For instance, iodomethane \\(\\ce{CH3I}\\) has a more polarizable iodine atom, resulting in a higher boiling point (42\u00b0C) compared to fluoromethane \\(\\ce{CH3F}\\) , which has the less polarizable fluorine atom and a much lower boiling point (-78\u00b0C) Melting point The melting point is the temperature at which a solid is converted to its liquid phase. In melting, energy is needed to overcome the attractive forces in the more ordered crystalline solid. Just like in the b.p. the stronger the intermolecular forces the higher the melting point. NOTE : given the same functional group, the more symmetrical the compund, the higher the melting point (???) Symmetricity? What the F you might say... Symmetry promotes efficient packing in the solid state, resulting in stronger intermolecular interactions and, thus, a higher melting point for more symmetrical compounds. - Symmetrical molecules pack more efficiently into a solid crystalline lattice because their shape allows them to align neatly. This tight packing leads to stronger intermolecular interactions in the solid state, which means more energy is required to disrupt these interactions during melting. Hence, a higher melting point . Less symmetrical molecules pack less efficiently, resulting in weaker intermolecular interactions in the solid state. These interactions are easier to overcome, leading to a lower melting point . Melting point trends For covalent molecules of approximately the same molecular weight, the melting point depends upon the identity of the functional group. The stronger the intermolecular attraction, the higher the melting points. The effect of symmetry on melting pointso For compunds having the same functional group and similar molecular weights, the more compact and symmetrical the shape, the higher the melting point . A compact symmetrical molecule like neopentane packs well into a crystalline lattice whereas isopentane does not. It has a much higher melting point than isopentane. NOTE : symmetricity is reffered to as the dregee of symm in a single molecule, not the composition of many of them although it influences it. Solubility Solubility is defined as the extend to which a compound, called a solute, dissolves in a liquid, called a solvent. The energy needed to break up the interactions between the molecules or ions of the solute comes from new interactions between the solute and the solvent. Solubility trends Compounds dissolve in solvents having similar kind of intermolecular forces \\(\\xrightarrow{slides quoting}\\) \\(\\text{Like dissolves like}\\) Polar compounds dissolve in polar solvents like water or alcohols capable of hydrogen bonding with the solute. Nonpolar or weakly polar compounds dissolve in nonpolar solvents (e.g., carbon tetrachloride and hexane). weakly polar solvents (e.g., diethyl ether) Polar compounds dissolve in polar solvents (like water or alcohol) due to strong interactions like hydrogen bonding or dipole-dipole forces . For example, salt dissolves in water because water can stabilize the ions. Nonpolar or weakly polar compounds dissolve in nonpolar solvents (like hexane or carbon tetrachloride) or weakly polar solvents (like diethyl ether). Nonpolar compounds interact through weak van der Waals forces , making them insoluble in polar solvents like water. Solubility in ionic compounds Most ionic compounds are soluble in water, but insoluble in organic solvents. To dissolve an ionic compund, the strong ion-ion interactions must be replaced by many weaker ion-dipole interactions. \ud83d\udca1 What is an ion-dipole interaction? An ion-dipole interaction is a type of intermolecular force that occurs between a charged ion and a polar molecule. The strength of this interaction depends on the magnitude of the charge on the ion and the dipole moment of the polar molecule. - The positive end of a dipole (in a polar molecule like water) is attracted to a negative ion (anion). - The negative end of a dipole is attracted to a positive ion (cation). Solubility of organic molecules An organic molecule is water soluble only if it contains one polar functional group capable of hydrogen bonding with the solvent for every five \\(\\ce{C}\\) atoms in contains. Compare the solubility of butane and acetone in \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) and \\(\\ce{CCl4}\\) Butane and acetone solubility Since butane and acetone are both organic compounds, they are both soluble in the organic solvent \\(\\ce{CCl4}\\) . Butane, which is nonpolar, is insoluble in \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) . Acetone is soluble in \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) because it contains only three \\(\\ce{C}\\) atoms and its \\(\\ce{O}\\) atom can hydrogen bond with an \\(\\ce{H}\\) atom of \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) . Water solubility of organic molecules The size of an organic molecule with a polar functional group determines its water solubility. A low molecular weight alcohol like ethanol is water soluble. On the other hand, Cholesterol, with 27 carbon atoms and only one OH group, has a carbon skeleton that is too large for the OH group to solubilize by hydrogen bonding \\(\\Rightarrow\\) cholesterol is insoluble in water Solubility Properties of Representative Compounds Type of Compound Solubility in H\u2082O Solubility in Organic Solvents (such as CCl\u2084) Ionic \\(\\ce{NaCl}\\) soluble insoluble Covalent \\(\\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH3}\\) insoluble (no N or O atom to hydrogen bond to \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) ) soluble \\(\\ce{CH3CH2CH2OH}\\) soluble ( \\(\\leq 5\\) C's and an O atom for hydrogen bonding to \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) ) soluble \\(\\ce{CH3(CH2)10OH}\\) insoluble ( \\(> 5\\) C's; too large to be soluble even though it has an O atom for hydrogen bonding to \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) ) soluble Vitamins Vitamins are organic compunds needed in small amounts for normal cell function, most cannot be synthesized in our bodies and must be obtained from diet. Most are identified by a letter, such as A, C, D, E and K. There are several different B vitamins, so a subscript is added just to distinguish between them. Examples are \\(\\ce{B_1}\\) , \\(\\ce{B_2}\\) and \\(\\ce{B_12}\\) . Vitamins can be fat soluble or water soluble depending on their structure Vitamin A Vitamin A is an essential component of the vision receptors in our eyes. Vitamin A or retinol may be obtained directly from diet . It also can be obtained from the conversion of \\(\\beta\\) -carotene, the orange pigment found in many plants including carrots, into vitamin A in our bodies. Vitamin A is water insoluble because it contains only one OH group and 20 carbon atoms. Vitamin C Vitamin C, ascorbic acid, is important in the formation of collagen. Most animals can synthesize vitamin C but Humans must obtain this vitamin from dietary sources, such as citrus fruits. Each carbon atom is bonded to an oxygen which makes it capable of hydrogen bonding, and thus, water soluble. Functional groups and electrophiles All functional groups contain a heteroatom, a bond, or both. These features create electrophilic sites and nucleophilic sites in a molecule. Electron-rich sites (nucleophiles) react with electron-poor sites (electrophiles) . An electronegative heteroatom like \\(\\ce{N}\\) , \\(\\ce{O}\\) , or \\(\\ce{X}\\) makes a carbon atom electrophilic, as shown below. In the examples, a partially positive carbon atom ( \\(\\delta^+\\) ) is attached to an electronegative atom (like $\\ce{Cl} or \\(\\ce{OH}\\) ), making the carbon electrophilic (electron-poor), which is susceptible to attack by nucleophiles. Nucleophilic sites in moleucules A lone pair on a heteroatom makes it basic and nucleophilic \\(\\pi\\) bonds create nucleophilic sites and are more easily broken than \\(\\sigma\\) bonds. An electron-rich carbon reacts with an electrophile, symbolized as \\(\\text{E}^+\\) . For example, alkenes contain an electron-rich double bond, and so they react with electrophiles \\(\\text{E}^+\\) . Alkyl halides possess an electrophilic carbon atom, so they react with electron-rich nucleophiles. Biomolecules Biomolecules are organic compounds found in biological systems. Many are relatively small, with molecular weights of less than 1000 g/mol. Biomolecules often have several functional groups.

Chemical Reactivity : Functional groups govern how molecules react with other substances, dictating the types of reactions they undergo, their reaction mechanisms, and their overall reactivity in organic synthesis. These aspects help chemists predict how molecules behave and interact based on their functional groups.","title":"Why functional groups matter"},{"location":"lectures/organic-chemistry/lesson-4_24-09-2024.html#what-are-intermolecular-forces","text":"Intermolecular forces are interactions that exist between molecules, functional groups determine the type and strength of these interactions.

Sidenote : This strong interaction is responsible for the high melting and boiling points of ionic compounds because a significant amount of energy is required to break these strong bonds. Ion-ion interactions are among the strongest types of attractive forces in chemistry because they involve full charges and lead to the stable, rigid structures seen in many ionic solids. This is what gives ionic compounds distinct physical properties, like hardness and high thermal stability. This image describes ion-ion interactions , which are the strong electrostatic attractions that occur between oppositely charged ions in ionic compounds.

This temporary dipole can induce a corresponding dipole in a neighboring molecule, leading to an induced dipole-induced dipole interaction .

These forces are especially important in nonpolar compounds, where no permanent dipoles exist to generate stronger interactions like hydrogen bonds or dipole-dipole forces.

NOTE : these all have two fewer \\(\\ce{H}\\) atoms than an acyclic alkane with the same number of carbons Understanding nomenclature The name of every organic molecule has 3 parts: The parent name indicates the number of carbons in the longest continuous chain. The suffix indicates what functional group is present. The prefix tells us the identity, location, and number of substituents attached to the carbon chain. \\[ \\text{prefix} + \\text{parent} + \\text{suffix} \\] Prefix: What and where are the substituents? Parent: What is the longest carbon chain? Suffix: What is the functional group? NOTE : substituents are atoms or groups of atoms that replace one or more hydrogen atoms attached to the main carbon chain (or parent structure) of a molecule. They modify the basic structure of the molecule and can significantly influence its chemical properties, reactivity, and naming. Naming substituents -Alkyl groups Carbon substituents bonded to a long carbon chain are called alkyl groups . An alkyl group is formed by removing one H atom from an alkane. To name an alkyl group, change the -ane ending of the parent alkane to -yl Methane \\(\\ce{CH4} ( \\(\\rightarrow\\) Methyl\\) \\ce{CH3}-\\) Ethane \\(\\ce{CH3CH3} ( \\(\\rightarrow\\) Ethyl\\) \\ce{CH3CH2}-\\) Naming three alkyl groups Naming three or four alkyl groups is more complicated because the parent hydrocarbons have more than one type of hydrogen atom. For example, consider propane: it has both 1 degree and 2 degrees \\(\\ce{H}\\) atoms and removal of each of these \\(\\ce{H}\\) atoms forms a different alkyl group with a different name, propyl or isopropyl. An alkyl group is derived from an alkane (a hydrocarbon with only single bonds) by removing one hydrogen atom. This allows the group to bond to another molecule (such as another carbon chain). When you remove a hydrogen atom from different positions on a molecule, you can create different alkyl groups. Explanation using propane In this example, the molecule in focus is propane ( \\(\\ce{C3H8}\\) ), which has 3 carbon atoms. Propane can form two different alkyl groups depending on where you remove a hydrogen atom: 1\u00b0 (Primary) Hydrogen : A primary hydrogen is attached to a primary carbon \u2014a carbon that is connected to only one other carbon . In propane, the hydrogens on the end carbons are primary hydrogens. If you remove one of these, you get a propyl group ( \\(\\ce{-CH2CH2CH3}\\) ). Propyl group : The name \"propyl\" refers to an alkyl group derived from propane by removing a hydrogen atom from one of the end carbon atoms. This gives you a linear chain that can attach to another molecule. 2\u00b0 (Secondary) Hydrogen : A secondary hydrogen is attached to a secondary carbon \u2014a carbon that is connected to two other carbons . In propane, the middle carbon is a secondary carbon. Removing a hydrogen from this middle carbon gives you an isopropyl group ( \\(\\ce{-(CH3)CHCH3}\\) ). Isopropyl group : This is a branched alkyl group where the middle carbon atom is attached to two methyl groups ( \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) ). It is derived by removing a hydrogen from the central carbon of propane, creating a Y-shaped branch. Propyl is created by removing a hydrogen from a primary carbon (end carbon) of propane. Isopropyl is created by removing a hydrogen from a secondary carbon (middle carbon) of propane. Why this matters Different alkyl groups can have different chemical properties and reactivity, even though they come from the same base molecule (propane in this case). This difference in structure is important in organic chemistry when naming compounds or predicting how molecules will react. Would you like to go into more details about primary and secondary carbons, or how these groups affect reactivity? Naming four different alkyl groups There are two different butane isomers which yield four possible alkyl groups containing four carbons. The prefixes like \"iso-\" , \"sec-\" , and \"tert-\" are used in the naming of alkyl groups to describe their branching patterns. These prefixes help specify how the alkyl group is attached and how the carbon atoms are arranged. Here's an explanation of each: \"n-\" (normal or straight) Meaning : No branching. Example: n-butyl ( \\(\\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2-}\\) ) This prefix is sometimes omitted when the alkyl group is a straight chain of carbon atoms, so butyl usually implies a straight chain unless otherwise specified. \"iso-\" (isomer) Meaning : The group has branching , specifically with a methyl group ( \\(\\ce{-CH3}\\) ) attached to the second carbon from the end of the chain. Example: isobutyl ( \\(\\ce{(CH3)2CHCH2-}\\) ) The \"iso-\" prefix indicates that the group has a branch at the second carbon, making the structure look like a \"Y.\" For isobutyl, this branching occurs at the second carbon of a three-carbon chain, with two \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) groups attached. \"sec-\" (secondary) Meaning : The hydrogen atom is removed from a secondary carbon (a carbon atom bonded to two other carbons). Example: sec-butyl ( \\(\\ce{CH3CH2CH(CH3)-}\\) ) In this structure, the branching happens because the hydrogen is removed from a secondary (2\u00b0) carbon, which is bonded to two other carbons. It indicates that the point of attachment is at the second carbon of the chain. \"tert-\" (tertiary) Meaning : The hydrogen atom is removed from a tertiary carbon (a carbon atom bonded to three other carbons ). Example: tert-butyl ( \\(\\ce{(CH3)3C-}\\) ) In this case, the \"tert-\" prefix tells us that the attachment occurs at a tertiary (3\u00b0) carbon, which is connected to three other carbons. This results in a highly branched structure. Butyl ( \\(\\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2-}\\) ): No branching (a straight chain). sec-Butyl ( \\(\\ce{CH3CH2CH(CH3)-}\\) ): The attachment happens at a secondary carbon . Isobutyl ( \\(\\ce{(CH3)2CHCH2-}\\) ): A branching with a methyl group attached to the second carbon. tert-Butyl ( \\(\\ce{(CH3)3C-}\\) ): A highly branched structure with the attachment at a tertiary carbon . How to name an alkane using the IUPAC System Step 1 : find the parent carbon chain and add the suffix If there are two chains of equal length, pick the chain with more substituents. In the following example, two different chains in the same alkane have seven \\(\\ce{C}\\) atoms. The left one identifies our main chain, as it contains a higher number of substituents. Step 2 : Numbering the atoms in the carbon chain to give the first substituent the lowest number. If the first substituent is the same distance from both ends, number the chain to give the second substituent the lower number When numbering a carbon chain results in the same numbers from either end of the chain, assign the lower number alphabetically to the first substituent Step 3 : Name and number the substituents. Name the substituents as alkyl groups. Every carbon belongs to either the longest chain or a substituent, not both. Each substituent needs its own number If two or more identical substituents are bonded to the longest chain, use prefixes to indicate how many: \"di-\" for two groups \"tri-\" for three groups \"tetra-\" for four groups and so forth. Step 4 : Combine substituents names and number + parent + suffixo Precede the name of the parent by the names of the substituents Alphabetize the names of the substituents, ignoring all prefixes except iso, as in isopropyl and isobutyl Precede the name of each substituent by the number that indicates its location NOTE : Separate numbers by commas and separate numbers from letters by hyphens. The name of an alkane is a single word, with no spaces after hyphens and commas. Wrapping up the steps Intepreting IUPAC naming via pseudocode function generateIUPACName(molecule) { // Step 1: Find the longest continuous carbon chain in the molecule parentChain = findLongestChain(molecule) // If there are multiple chains with the same length, pick the one that has the most substituents attached if (multipleChainsWithSameLength(molecule)) { parentChain = chooseChainWithMostSubstituents(chains) } // Step 2: Number the carbons in the parent chain starting from the end that gives the first substituent the lowest possible number numberedChain = numberChain(parentChain) // Step 3: Identify all substituents attached to the chain and note their positions substituents = findSubstituents(numberedChain) // Ensure the numbering gives the first substituent the smallest number numberedChain = minimizeFirstSubstituentNumber(numberedChain, substituents) // If the first substituent is equally far from both ends, adjust numbering to give the second substituent the lower number numberedChain = handleEqualPositionForFirstSubstituent(numberedChain, substituents) // Step 4: Name and number the substituents for each substituent in substituents { // Get the alkyl name for the substituent (e.g., methyl, ethyl) name = getAlkylName(substituent) // If there are multiple identical substituents, add the correct prefix (di-, tri-) count = countIdenticalSubstituents(substituents, substituent) prefix = count > 1 ? getPrefixForCount(count) : \"\" // Combine the position number, prefix, and name for the substituent substituentNames.push(substituent.position + \"-\" + prefix + name) } // Step 5: Sort the substituent names alphabetically, ignoring di-, tri-, tetra-, except for iso- substituentNames.sortAlphabetically() // Step 6: Build the full IUPAC name by joining all the substituent names, followed by the parent chain name parentName = getParentChainName(parentChain.length) iupacName = combineNames(substituentNames, parentName) return iupacName } How to name a cycloalkane using the IUAPAC Cycloalkanes are named using similar rules, but the prefix cyclo immediately precedes the name of the parent. \\[ \\text{prefix} + \\text{\"cyclo-\"} + \\text{parent} + \\text{suffix} \\] 1. Prefix \\(\\rightarrow\\) What and where are the substituents? 3. Parent \\(\\rightarrow\\) How many C's are in the ring? 4. Suffix : \\(\\rightarrow\\) What is the functional group? Step 1 : find the parent cycloalkane Step 2 : name and number the substituents. No number is needed to indicate the location of a single substituent. For rings with more than one substituent, begin numbering at one substituent and proceed around the ring to give the second substituent the lowest number Then, just as in alkanes : with two different substituents, number the ring to assign the lower number to the substituents alphabetically. Naming alkanes vs. cycloalkanes If the number of carbons in the ring is greater than or equal to the number of carbons in the longest chain, the compound is named as a cycloalkane. If there are more carbons in the chain, the compound is named as an alkane. Sidenote Whenever a cycloalkane has at least two substituents, one of them will always be assigned position 1, and here's why: Position 1 is always assigned to one of the substituents: The ring numbering always starts at one of the carbons that has a substituent. So, in cases with two or more substituents, the IUPAC rules ensure that one substituent is at position 1. The numbering is done to minimize the numbers assigned to the rest of the substituents: After position 1 is assigned, the remaining substituents are numbered to follow the lowest locant rule. If there are multiple ways to number the ring, alphabetical order is used to decide which substituent gets position 1. A few examples more Common Names for some Polycyclic Alkanes Some organic compounds are identified using common names that do not follow the IUPAC system of nomenclature. Many of these names were given long ago before the IUPAC system was adopted, and are still widely used. Additionally, some names are descriptive of shape and structure, like those below Fossil Fuels Many alkanes occur in nature, primarily in natural gas and petroleum. Natural gas is composed largely of methane, with lesser amounts of ethane, propane, and butane. Methane in the atmosphere comes from both natural and manmade sources. Petroleum is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, containing 1 to 40 carbon atoms. Refining of Oil Distilling crude petroleum (refining) separates it into fractions that differ in boiling point: Gasoline : C \\(_5\\) H \\(_{12}\\) \u2013 C \\(_{12}\\) H \\(_{26}\\) Kerosene : C \\(_{12}\\) H \\(_{26}\\) \u2013 C \\(_{16}\\) H \\(_{34}\\) Diesel fuel : C \\(_{15}\\) H \\(_{32}\\) \u2013 C \\(_{18}\\) H \\(_{36}\\) Properties of Alkanes Alkanes contain only nonpolar C\u2014C and C\u2014H bonds. They only exhibit weak van der Waals forces . This affects solubility , boiling points , and melting points of alkanes. Solubility of alkanes : Alkanes are more soluble in organic solvents . Alkanes are insoluble in water . Boiling and melting points of alkanes Alkanes have low bp\u2019s and mp\u2019s compared to more polar compounds of comparable size. Bp and mp increase as the number of carbons increases due to increased surface area. The bp of isomers decreases with branching due to decreased surface area, while Mp increases with increased symmetry. Conformation of acyclic alkanes Conformations are different arrangements of atoms that are interconverted by rotation about single bonds Names are given to two different conformations: Eclipsed conformation : The \\(\\ce{C\u2014H}\\) bonds on one carbon are directly aligned with the \\(\\ce{C\u2014H}\\) bonds on the adjacent carbon. Staggered conformation : The \\(\\ce{C\u2014H}\\) bonds on one carbon bisect the \\(\\ce{H\u2014C\u2014H}\\) bond angle on the adjacent carbon. Rotating the atoms on one carbon by 60 degrees converts an eclipsed conformation into a staggered conformation, and vice versa. The angle that separates a bond on one atom from a bond on an adjacent atom is called a dihedral angle . For ethane in the staggered conformation, the dihedral angle for the \\(\\ce{C\u2014H}\\) bonds is 60 degrees; for eclipsed ethane, it is 0 degrees. Newman projections, drawing and understanding End-on representations for conformations are commonly drawn using a convention called a Newman projection . Step 1: Look directly down the C\u2014C bond (end-on), and draw a circle with a dot in the center to represent the carbons of the C\u2014C bond. Step 2: Draw in the bonds. Draw the bonds on the front carbon \\(\\ce{C}\\) as three lines meeting at the center of the circle. Draw the bonds on the back carbon \\(\\ce{C}\\) as three lines coming out of the edge of the circle. Step 3: Add the atoms on each bond. Newman Projections, Ethane The staggered and eclipsed conformations of ethane interconvert at room temperature. The staggered conformations are more stable (lower in energy) than the eclipsed conformations . In the staggered form the atoms attached to the carbons are positioned as far away from each other as possible, minimizing the repulsion between electrons in adjacent bonds. In contrast, the eclipsed conformation has increased electron-electron repulsion as the bonds are aligned, leading to higher energy and instability. Electron-electron repulsion between bonds in the eclipsed conformation increases its energy compared with the staggered conformation, where the bonding electrons are farther apart. Torsional energy in ethane The difference in energy between staggered and eclipsed conformers is \\(\\text{~3 kcal/mol}\\) , with each eclipsed \\(\\ce{C\u2014H}\\) bond contributing \\(\\text{1 kcal/mol}\\) . The energy difference between staggered and eclipsed conformers is called torsional energy. NOTE : Torsional strain is an increase in energy caused by eclipsing interactions. Another example of conformations is propane Energy minimums and maximums occur every 60\u00b0 as the conformation swaps: staggered \\(\\rightarrow\\) eclipsed. Conformations that are in neither one of the two states are said to be intermediate in energy. Butane, like many other high mol weight alkanes have several \\(\\ce{C-C}\\) bonds, capable of rotation. Anti and gauche conformations A staggered conformation with two larger groups 180\u00b0 from each other is called anti whereas a staggered conformation with two larger groups 60\u00b0 from each other is called gauche . The relative energies of the individual staggered conformations depend on their steric strain. Steric strain is an increase in energy resulting when non-bonded atoms are forced too close to each other. The result \\(\\rightarrow\\) gauche conformations are generally higher in energy than anti conformations because of steric strain. \\[ \\text{Steric strain caused by two eclipsed } \\ce{CH3} \\text{ groups} \\] Energy and dihedral angle values in buthane Staggered conformations 1, 3, and 5 are at energy minima. Anti conformation 1 is lower in energy than gauche conformations 3 and 5, which possess steric strain. Eclipsed conformations 2, 4, and 6 are at energy maxima. Eclipsed conformation 4, which has additional steric strain due to two eclipsed \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) groups, is highest in energy. Torsional and steric strain energies in acyclic alkanes The energy difference between the lowest and highest energy conformations is called a barrier to rotation . Type of interaction Energy Increase (KJ/mol) Energy Increase (Kcal/mol) H,H eclipsing 4.0 1.0 H,CH\u2083 eclipsing 6.0 1.4 CH\u2083,CH\u2083 eclipsing 11 2.6 gauche CH\u2083 groups 3.8 0.9 The barrier to rotation determines how easily or freely a molecule can rotate around a single bond. If the barrier is small, the molecule can rotate relatively easily, whereas a large barrier would restrict free rotation. The barrier to rotation is mainly caused by torsional strain (due to eclipsed conformations, where atoms or groups are aligned and experience repulsive interactions) and, in some cases, steric strain (when large substituents clash as the molecule rotates). Drawing Zigzag skeletal structures Since the lowest energy conformations has all bonds staggered and all larger groups in an anti conformation, alkanes are drawn using zigzag skeletal structures to reflect this. Angle strain in cycloalkanes Besides torsional and steric strain, the conformations of cycloalkanes are also affected by angle strain \\(\\rightarrow\\) an incrementail increase in energy when bond angle deviate from the optimal 109.5\u00b0 angles found in tethrahedral structures. NOTE : Cycloalkanes with more than three \\(\\ce{C}\\) atoms in the ring are not flat molecules. They are puckered to reduce strain. Cycloalkanes distort their shape in to alleviate angle and torsional strain The image below illustrates that if cyclohexane were flat, it would experience angle strain due to the bond angles being 120\u00b0, larger than the ideal 109.5\u00b0. Additionally, all hydrogens would be aligned in an eclipsed conformation , causing torsional strain . A flat cyclohexane structure would suffer from angle strain , as the bond angles (120\u00b0) deviate from the ideal tetrahedral angle (109.5\u00b0), and torsional strain , due to eclipsed hydrogens. Cyclohexane adopts a chair conformation to minimize these strains, creating a more stable, lower-energy structure. The chair conformation is so stable because it eliminates angle strain (all \\(\\ce{C\u2014C\u2014C}\\) angles are 109.5 degrees), and torsional strain (all hydrogens on adjacent \\(\\ce{C}\\) atoms are staggered). In cyclohexane, three C atoms pucker up and three C atoms pucker down, alternating around the ring. Axial vs Equatorial 1. Axial Hydrogens : These hydrogens point straight up or down , perpendicular to the plane of the ring. There are six axial hydrogens, one on each carbon atom. They alternate in direction\u2014if one carbon has an axial hydrogen pointing up, the next carbon will have its axial hydrogen pointing down. Equatorial Hydrogens : These hydrogens point outwards around the ring , roughly parallel to the plane of the ring. They are spread out more, reducing crowding (steric strain), and are positioned in a staggered way with respect to the axial hydrogens. In simple terms, axial hydrogens stick straight up or down , while equatorial hydrogens stick out sideways around the ring. This arrangement helps reduce strain in the cyclohexane molecule, making the chair conformation very stable. Drawing the chair form of cyclohexane Step 1 : draw the carbon skeleton Draw the three parts of the chair, a wedge, a set of parallel lines and another wedge Join them together The bottom \\(\\ce{C}\\) 's come out of the page, bonds to them are sometimes in bold Step 2 : label the up \\(\\ce{C}\\) 's and the down \\(\\ce{C}\\) 's on the ring There are 3 up and 3 down, they alternate around the ring Step 3 : draw in the axial H atoms On an up \\(\\ce{C}\\) the axial \\(\\ce{H}\\) 's is up On a down \\(\\ce{C}\\) the axial \\(\\ce{H}\\) is down Step 4 : Draw in the equatorial \\(\\ce{H}\\) atoms The axial \\(\\ce{H}\\) is down on a down \\(\\ce{C}\\) , so the equatorial \\(\\ce{H}\\) must be up On a \"down\" carbon, the axial hydrogen points straight down, and the equatorial hydrogen points slightly upward The axial \\(\\ce{H}\\) is up on an up \\(\\ce{C}\\) , so the equatorial \\(\\ce{H}\\) must be down On an \"up\" carbon, the axial hydrogen points straight up, and the equatorial hydrogen points slightly downward Ring flipping Cyclohexanes undergo a conformational change called ring-flipping As a result of a ring flip, the up carbons become down carbons and the down carbons become up carbons. Axial and equatorial \\(\\ce{H}\\) atoms are also interconverted during a ring-flip ; axial \\(\\ce{H}\\) atoms become equatorial \\(\\ce{H}\\) atoms and equatorial \\(\\ce{H}\\) atoms become axial. YT: visualize ring flipping There are two possible chair conformations, the equatorial position has more room than the axial position \\(\\Rightarrow\\) larger substituents are more stable in the equatorial positions. Cyclohexane also can exist in a boat conformation. The boat forms of cyclohexane are \\(\\text{7 kcal/mol}\\) less stable than the chair forms. The boat conformation is destabilized by torsional strain because the hydrogens on the four carbon atoms in the plane are eclipsed. Additionally, there is steric strain because two hydrogens at either end of the boat, the \"flag pole\" hydrogens, are forced close to each other. While less stable, the boat conformation is not a fixed state. Cyclohexane molecules are constantly undergoing a conformational change called \"ring-flipping,\" which interconverts between different conformations, including the boat conformation. However, due to its higher energy, the boat conformation is less populated compared to the chair conformations at equilibrium. In the context of conformational analysis, \"population\" refers to the relative abundance of different conformations of a molecule at equilibrium. Molecules in a solution constantly interconvert between different conformations due to bond rotation. The distribution of molecules among these different conformations is determined by their relative energies \\(\\Rightarrow\\) at equilibrium, a greater proportion of cyclohexane molecules will exist in the chair conformation, making it more populated than the boat conformation. Drawing conformations for a substituted cyclohexane Step 1 : Draw one chair form and add the substituents Arbitrarily pick a ring carbon, classify it as an up or down carbon, and draw the bonds. Each \\(\\ce{C}\\) has one axial and one equatorial bond. Add the substituents \\(\\ce{H}\\) and \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) placing one axial and one equatorial This forms conformation \\(\\ce{A}\\) Step 2 : Ring flip the cyclohexane ring Convert the up \\(\\ce{C}\\) 's to down \\(\\ce{C}\\) 's and vice versa. The chosen \\(\\ce{C}\\) now puckers down. Step 3 : Add the substituents to the second conformation Draw axial and equatorial bonds. On a down \\(\\ce{C}\\) the axial bond is down. Ring flipping converts axial bonds to equatorial bonds. The equatorial \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) becomes axial. This forms Conformation B. The two chair conformations of cyclohexane are different, so they are not equally stable. Larger axial substituents create destabilizing \\(\\text{1,3-diaxial interactions}\\) . In methylcyclohexane, each unfavorable \\(\\ce{H}\\) , \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) interaction destabilizes the conformation by \\(\\text{0.9 kcal/mol}\\) , so Conformation \\(\\ce{B}\\) \\(\\text{is 1.8 kcal/mol}\\) less stable than Conformation \\(\\text{A}\\) . In simple terms, methylcyclohexane is a molecule that can exist in different shapes (called conformations). These shapes can change when the ring structure (cyclohexane) flips. In one of these shapes, Conformation A, the bulky methyl group ( \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) ) is in a position where it doesn't clash much with the nearby hydrogen atoms. This makes Conformation A more stable. However, when the ring flips to Conformation B, the methyl group is in a position where it interacts closely with the hydrogen atoms. These interactions are unfavorable because the atoms are too close to each other, causing strain. Each of these interactions adds 0.9 kcal/mol of energy, which makes the molecule less stable. Since there are two such interactions in Conformation B, the total increase in energy is \\(2 \\times 0.9 = \\text{1.8 kcal/mol}\\) . This means Conformation B is \\(\\text{1.8 kcal/mol}\\) less stable than Conformation A because of these clashes between the hydrogen atoms and the methyl group. \ud83d\udca1 What is meant by diaxial? Diaxial interactions happen when a group in the axial position of cyclohexane interacts with axial hydrogens on the same side of the ring. When a bulky group, such as a methyl group \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) , is placed in an axial position on the cyclohexane ring, it can come into close contact with the axial hydrogens on the same side of the ring. These are called diaxial interactions because they involve two axial substituents (the methyl group and the hydrogen atoms). The larger the substituent on the six-membered ring the higher the percentage of equatorial conformation at equilibrium: - With a very large substituent like tert-butyl \\(\\ce{(CH3)3C-}\\) essentially none of the of the conformation containing an axial tert-butyl group is present at room temperature This example illustrates a fundamental concept in cyclohexane chair conformations: steric hindrance and the influence of large substituents on the stability of axial versus equatorial positions. Steric Hindrance in the Axial Position : - The tert-butyl group \\((CH_3)_3C^\u2212\\) is very large and bulky. When positioned in the axial position (structure C), this group experiences significant steric crowding from the other axial hydrogens on carbons 3 and 5, known as 1,3-diaxial interactions . These interactions create a highly destabilized environment for the tert-butyl group in the axial position, as depicted by the \"very crowded\" labeling and highlighted hydrogens in structure C. Stabilization in the Equatorial Position : - In the equatorial position (structure D), the bulky tert-butyl group points outward, away from the other groups on the ring, significantly reducing steric interactions with nearby atoms. This position minimizes steric hindrance, making the equatorial conformation far more stable for such a large group. Disubstituted cycloalkanes There are two different 1,2-dimethylcyclopentanes : - One having two \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) groups on the same side of the ring - One having them on opposite sides of the ring \\[ \\text{A and B are said to be \"stereoisomers\"} \\] Stereoisomers are isomers that differ only in the way the atoms are oriented in space. The prefix cis and trans are used to distinguish these isomers. - The cis isomer has two groups on the same side of the ring - The trans isomer has two groups on opposite sides of the ring A disubstituted cycloalkane, such as 1,4-dimethylcyloahexane , also has cis and trans stereoisomers. Each of these stereoisomers has two possible chair conformations. How to draw Disubstituted cycloalkanes Step 1 : Draw one chair form and add the substituents For trans-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane, pick two \\(\\ce{C}\\) 's located 1,4- to each other, classify them as up or down and draw in the substituents. The trans isomer must have one group above the ring (on an up bond) and one gorup below the ring (on a down bond). This is a diaxial arrangement. The result is conformation \\(\\ce{A}\\) Step 2 : Ring-flip the cyclohexane ring The up \\(\\ce{C}\\) flips down, the down \\(\\ce{C}\\) flips up Step 3 : Add the substituents to the second conformation Ring-flipping converts axial bonds to equatorial and vice versa Ending notes Trans disubstituted cycloalkanes Conformations \\(\\ce{A}\\) and \\(\\ce{B}\\) are not equally stable. Because conformation \\(\\ce{B}\\) has both \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) groups in the roomier equatorial position, it is lower in energy. A trans isomer has two substituents on opposite sides, one up and one down. Cis disubstituted cycloalkanes A cis isomer has two groups on the same side of the ring, either both up or both down. In the following example, conformations \\(\\ce{C}\\) and \\(\\ce{D}\\) have two \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) groups down up . Both conformations have one \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) group axial and one equatorial, making them equally stable. Oxidation and reduction reactions Oxidation results in an increase in the number of \\(\\ce{C-Z}\\) bonds. Oxidation results in an decrease in the number of \\(\\ce{C-H}\\) bonds. Reduction results in an decrease in the number of \\(\\ce{C-Z}\\) bonds. Reduction results in an increase in the number of \\(\\ce{C-H}\\) bonds. Combustion of alkanes Alkanes undergo combustion, that is they burn in the presence of oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water. This is an example of an oxidation-reduction reaction. Every \\(\\ce{C-H}\\) and \\(\\ce{C-C}\\) bond in the starting material is converted to a \\(\\ce{C-O}\\) bond in the product.","title":"Organic Chemistry, Academic Year 2024/2025"},{"location":"lectures/organic-chemistry/lesson-5_27-09-2024.html#organic-chemistry-academic-year-20242025","text":"Organic Chemistry, Academic Year 2024/2025 Alkanes and cycloalkanes, structures, conformations and newman projections Tetrahedral geometry of Carbon Drawing compounds Constitutional isomers Cycloalkanes Understanding nomenclature Naming substituents -Alkyl groups Naming three alkyl groups Explanation using propane Why this matters Naming four different alkyl groups How to name an alkane using the IUPAC System Wrapping up the steps How to name a cycloalkane using the IUAPAC Naming alkanes vs. cycloalkanes Common Names for some Polycyclic Alkanes Fossil Fuels Refining of Oil Properties of Alkanes Boiling and melting points of alkanes Conformation of acyclic alkanes Newman projections, drawing and understanding Newman Projections, Ethane Torsional energy in ethane Anti and gauche conformations Energy and dihedral angle values in buthane Torsional and steric strain energies in acyclic alkanes Drawing Zigzag skeletal structures Angle strain in cycloalkanes Drawing the chair form of cyclohexane Ring flipping Drawing conformations for a substituted cyclohexane Disubstituted cycloalkanes How to draw Disubstituted cycloalkanes Ending notes Trans disubstituted cycloalkanes Cis disubstituted cycloalkanes Oxidation and reduction reactions Combustion of alkanes","title":"Organic Chemistry, Academic Year 2024/2025"},{"location":"lectures/organic-chemistry/lesson-5_27-09-2024.html#alkanes-and-cycloalkanes-structures-conformations-and-newman-projections","text":"","title":"Alkanes and cycloalkanes, structures, conformations and newman projections"},{"location":"lectures/organic-chemistry/lesson-5_27-09-2024.html#tetrahedral-geometry-of-carbon","text":"All C atoms in an alkane are surrounded by four groups, making them \\(\\ce{sp^3}\\) hybridized and tetrahedral, with all bond angles of \\(\\text{109.5\u00b0}\\) .

The prefixes like \"iso-\" , \"sec-\" , and \"tert-\" are used in the naming of alkyl groups to describe their branching patterns. These prefixes help specify how the alkyl group is attached and how the carbon atoms are arranged. Here's an explanation of each: \"n-\" (normal or straight) Meaning : No branching. Example: n-butyl ( \\(\\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2-}\\) ) This prefix is sometimes omitted when the alkyl group is a straight chain of carbon atoms, so butyl usually implies a straight chain unless otherwise specified. \"iso-\" (isomer) Meaning : The group has branching , specifically with a methyl group ( \\(\\ce{-CH3}\\) ) attached to the second carbon from the end of the chain. Example: isobutyl ( \\(\\ce{(CH3)2CHCH2-}\\) ) The \"iso-\" prefix indicates that the group has a branch at the second carbon, making the structure look like a \"Y.\" For isobutyl, this branching occurs at the second carbon of a three-carbon chain, with two \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) groups attached. \"sec-\" (secondary) Meaning : The hydrogen atom is removed from a secondary carbon (a carbon atom bonded to two other carbons). Example: sec-butyl ( \\(\\ce{CH3CH2CH(CH3)-}\\) ) In this structure, the branching happens because the hydrogen is removed from a secondary (2\u00b0) carbon, which is bonded to two other carbons. It indicates that the point of attachment is at the second carbon of the chain. \"tert-\" (tertiary) Meaning : The hydrogen atom is removed from a tertiary carbon (a carbon atom bonded to three other carbons ). Example: tert-butyl ( \\(\\ce{(CH3)3C-}\\) ) In this case, the \"tert-\" prefix tells us that the attachment occurs at a tertiary (3\u00b0) carbon, which is connected to three other carbons.

Steric Hindrance in the Axial Position : - The tert-butyl group \\((CH_3)_3C^\u2212\\) is very large and bulky. When positioned in the axial position (structure C), this group experiences significant steric crowding from the other axial hydrogens on carbons 3 and 5, known as 1,3-diaxial interactions . These interactions create a highly destabilized environment for the tert-butyl group in the axial position, as depicted by the \"very crowded\" labeling and highlighted hydrogens in structure C. Stabilization in the Equatorial Position : - In the equatorial position (structure D), the bulky tert-butyl group points outward, away from the other groups on the ring, significantly reducing steric interactions with nearby atoms.

Recall: constitutional isomers Isomers are different compunds having the same molecular formula but different structure. The two major classes of isomers are constitutional isomers and stereo isomers. Constitutional/structural isomers have different IUPAC names same or different functional groups different physical properties different chemical properties Stereoisomers Differ only in the way the atoms are oriented in space Have identical IUPAC names (except for prefixes like \"cis\" and \"trans\") Always have the same functional groups Differ in configuration Chirality and Achirality Concept of superimposability and enantiomers Chirality in molecules refers to the property of having a non-superimposable mirror image, similar to how left and right hands are mirror images but cannot be perfectly aligned. Molecules that cannot be superimposed on their mirror images are called chiral. Achirality in molecules refers to the property of having a superimposable mirror image, like a pair of identical socks. Molecules that can be perfectly aligned with their mirror images are considered achiral. Achiral Molecules We can now consider several molecules to determine whether or not they are chiral . The bonds and atoms of \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) align perfectly with its mirror image, making it achiral. Similarly, \\(\\ce{CH2BrCl}\\) is also achiral as its mirror image can be rotated to perfectly align with itself. Chiral Molecules The molecule \\(\\ce{A}\\) and its mirror image labeled \\(\\ce{B}\\) are not superimposable. No matter how you rotate \\(\\ce{A}\\) and \\(\\ce{B}\\) , the atoms never align. Thus, \\(\\ce{CHBrClF}\\) is a chiral molecule, with \\(\\ce{A}\\) and \\(\\ce{B}\\) as distinct compounds. A and B are stereoisomers\u2014specifically, they are enantiomers . A carbon atom with four different groups is a tetrahedral stereogenic center . Stereogenic centers In general, a molecule with no stereogenic centers will not be chiral (though there are exceptions) - With no stereogenic center a molecule will always be chiral - With two or more stereogenic centers a molecule may or may not be chiral The most common cause, albeit not the only one, of chirality in an organic molecule is the presence of a tetrahedral atom, generally a carbon, linked to four different groups (stereogenic center). In order for a molecule to be chiral, it must not have a plane of symmetry Planes of symmetry A plane of symmetry is a mirror plane that cuts the molecule in half, so that one half of the molecule is a reflection of the other half. Achiral molecules usually contain a plane of symmetry but chiral molecules do not Chirality recap Everything has a mirror image. The fundamental question in chirality is whether a molecule and its mirror image are superimposable. If they are not superimposable, the molecule is chiral and lacks a plane of symmetry. If the mirror images are superimposable, the molecule is achiral and will contain a plane of symmetry. While the terms \"stereogenic center\" and \"chiral molecule\" are related, they are distinct. A chiral molecule must have one or more stereogenic centers. Looking for stereogenic centers To locate a stereogenic center, examine each tetrahedral carbon atom in a molecule, focusing on the four distinct groups\u2014rather than the four atoms\u2014attached to it. Always exclude carbon atoms that cannot be tetrahedral stereogenic centers: - CH\u2082 and CH\u2083 groups : These groups do not have four distinct substituents. For example, CH\u2082 has two identical hydrogen atoms, and CH\u2083 has three, making them incapable of forming a chiral center. - sp or sp\u00b2 hybridized carbons : These carbons are not tetrahedral; they are linear (sp) or trigonal planar (sp\u00b2) and therefore cannot possess the three-dimensional geometry necessary for chirality. Larger organic molecules can have two, three, or even hundreds of stereogenic centers Enantiomers Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror image molecules. Any molecule with one stereogenic center exists as a pair of enantiomers. To draw both enantiomers of a chiral compound such as 2-butanol, use the typical convention for depicting a tetrahedron. For the first enantiomer, arbitrarily place the four groups\u2014 \\(\\ce{H}\\) , \\(\\ce{OH}\\) , \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) , and \\(\\ce{CH2CH3}\\) \u2014on any bond to the stereogenic center. Then, draw the mirror image. In the example, molecules A and B represent the two enantiomers of 2-butanol. These mirror images are not superimposable, confirming their status as enantiomers. Stereogenic centers in cyclic compounds Stereogenic centers may also occur at carbon atoms that are part of a ring. To find stereogenic centers on ring carbons, always draw the rings as flat polygons, and look for tetrahedral carbons that are bonded to four different groups. Examples and biologically active mols with stereogenic centers In 3-methylcyclohexene , the \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) and \\(\\ce{H}\\) substituents that are above and below the plane of the ring are drawn with wedges and dashes as usual. Labelliing stereogenic centers using R or S Since enantiomers are distinct compounds with unique spatial arrangements, they are distinguished by adding the prefix R or S to their IUPAC names. This designation helps identify the specific 3D orientation of each enantiomer. Steps to Assign R/S Configuration Rule 1: To assign an enantiomer as R or S , priorities must be given to each group attached to the stereogenic center, following these guidelines: - Prioritize each group based on the atomic number of the atom directly attached to the stereogenic center. - The atom with the highest atomic number receives the highest priority, labeled as 1 . For example, if the groups attached to the stereogenic center are \\(\\ce{H}\\) , \\(\\ce{OH}\\) , \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) , and \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) : - \\(\\ce{Br}\\) has the highest atomic number among the attached atoms, so it is assigned priority 1 . - \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) has the next highest atomic number, giving it priority 2 . - \\(\\ce{F}\\) comes next, with priority 3 . - \\(\\ce{H}\\) , having the lowest atomic number, is assigned priority 4 . Rule 2 for Assigning R/S Configuration When two atoms attached to the stereogenic center are identical, assign priority based on the atomic number of the atoms bonded to these identical atoms. The atom with the higher atomic number among these bonded atoms determines the higher priority. Consider the stereogenic center in butan-2-ol, where the groups attached to the chiral carbon are \\(\\ce{OH}\\) , \\(\\ce{CH2CH3}\\) , \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) , and \\(\\ce{H}\\) . Applying Rule 1 : \\(\\ce{OH}\\) has the highest atomic number and thus receives priority 1 . Hydrogen ( \\(\\ce{H}\\) ), with the lowest atomic number, is given priority 4 . Applying Rule 2 for \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) and \\(\\ce{CH2CH3}\\) : Both \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) and \\(\\ce{CH2CH3}\\) are initially similar because each group has a carbon directly attached to the stereogenic center. To break the tie, examine the atoms bonded to these carbons. In \\(\\ce{CH2CH3}\\) , the carbon is bonded to two hydrogens and another carbon (higher atomic number). In \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) , the carbon is bonded to three hydrogens only. Since \\(\\ce{CH2CH3}\\) has a carbon attached (higher atomic number than hydrogen), it receives priority 2 , while \\(\\ce{CH3}\\) is assigned priority 3 . Rule 3 for Assigning R/S Configuration If two isotopes of the same element are bonded to the stereogenic center, assign priorities based on their mass numbers , with the isotope of higher mass receiving the higher priority. When comparing isotopes of hydrogen: - Deuterium ( \\(\\ce{D}\\) ), with a mass number of 2 (1 proton and 1 neutron), has a higher priority than hydrogen ( \\(\\ce{H}\\) ), which has a mass number of 1 (1 proton only). - Therefore, if both deuterium and hydrogen are attached to a stereogenic center, deuterium will receive a higher priority than hydrogen. This rule ensures that isotopic differences are considered when determining the R/S configuration of a chiral center. \ud83d\udca1 What are isotopes? Isotopes are different forms of the same chemical element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei. Because the number of protons defines the element, isotopes share the same atomic number but differ in mass number (the sum of protons and neutrons). In stereochemistry, isotopes are important because they allow us to differentiate between otherwise identical atoms based on their mass, affecting priority assignments in chiral centers. Rule 4 for Assigning R/S Configuration: Multiple Bonds When assigning priority to an atom involved in a multiple bond (double or triple bond), treat the multiply bonded atom as if it were connected to an equivalent number of singly bonded atoms. For example: - In a \\(\\ce{C=O}\\) double bond, the carbon is treated as if it is bonded to two separate oxygen atoms. - This equivalent bonding approach allows us to compare priorities effectively in complex molecules. Consider a molecule with a carbonyl group ( \\(\\ce{C=O}\\) ): - The carbon in \\(\\ce{C=O}\\) is considered to be bonded to two \"virtual\" oxygens. - Similarly, each oxygen in this group is considered bonded to two \"virtual\" carbons. This equivalent bonding rule helps in assigning priorities correctly when determining the R/S configuration in molecules with double or triple bonds. HOW TO ACTUALLY ASSIGN R or S, QUICKLY Assign Priorities : Rank the four groups attached to the stereogenic center by atomic number (highest atomic number = priority 1). If two groups have the same atom, apply Rule 2 to rank based on the next atoms along each branch. Orient the Molecule : Arrange the molecule so that the lowest priority group (4) is pointing away from you (on a dashed wedge). Visualize only the remaining three groups (1, 2, and 3) in the plane. Determine R or S : Trace a path from priority \\(\\text{ 1 } \\rightarrow \\text{ 2 } \\rightarrow \\text{ 3 }\\) . Clockwise = R (rectus). Counterclockwise = S (sinister). Example Summary If the circle from \\(\\text{ 1 } \\rightarrow \\text{ 2 } \\rightarrow \\text{ 3 }\\) is clockwise, label as R . If the circle from \\(\\text{ 1 } \\rightarrow \\text{ 2 } \\rightarrow \\text{ 3 }\\) is counterclockwise, label as S . The letter R or S preceeds the IUPAC name of the molecule using a prefix (S)- or (R)- NOTE : If the lowest priority group is not facing towards back, rotate the molecule 120 degrees around a stationary bond axis.","title":"Organic Chemistry, Academic Year 2024/2025"},{"location":"lectures/organic-chemistry/lesson-6_1-10-2024.html#organic-chemistry-academic-year-20242025","text":"Organic Chemistry, Academic Year 2024/2025 Fundamentals of Stereochemistry: Chirality, Stereogenic Centers, Descriptors, Isomerism, and Optical Activity Stereochemistry Recall: constitutional isomers Chirality and Achirality Concept of superimposability and enantiomers Achiral Molecules Chiral Molecules Stereogenic centers Planes of symmetry Chirality recap Looking for stereogenic centers Enantiomers Stereogenic centers in cyclic compounds Labelliing stereogenic centers using R or S HOW TO ACTUALLY ASSIGN R or S, QUICKLY Example Summary","title":"Organic Chemistry, Academic Year 2024/2025"},{"location":"lectures/organic-chemistry/lesson-6_1-10-2024.html#fundamentals-of-stereochemistry-chirality-stereogenic-centers-descriptors-isomerism-and-optical-activity","text":"","title":"Fundamentals of Stereochemistry: Chirality, Stereogenic Centers, Descriptors, Isomerism, and Optical Activity"},{"location":"lectures/organic-chemistry/lesson-6_1-10-2024.html#stereochemistry","text":"Stereochemistry refers to the three-dimensional structure of a molecule.
