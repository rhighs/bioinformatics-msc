# [Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics - MSc Repository 2024/2025](https://www.unimi.it/en/education/master-programme/bioinformatics-computational-genomics)

This repository serves as a central hub for my personal notes, scripts, code, and other resources that Iâ€™ve accumulated during the course of
my studies. The goal is to create a valuable resource for both myself and others who are interested in the field, whether they are fellow
students or collaborators.

This all really is just a [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) project which can be accessed [here](https://rhighs.github.io/bioinformatics-msc).
Most of the project is still WIP and quite unstructured. 

## A brief overview

- **Lecture Notes**: Comprehensive notes from lectures. Mostly markdown with support for inline and block LaTeX syntax.
- **Scripts and Code**: scripts and code examples.
- **Assignments and Projects**: Solutions to assignments, along with code and reports from projects.
- **Resources**: A collection of links to research papers, tutorials, and other materials that are relevant to the courses and topics covered.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have notes, code, or resources that you think would be valuable to others, feel free to submit a pull request or contact me directly.

**NOTE**:
A few recommendations:

- Notes:
  - Write notes as markdown files.
  - This format is easy to understand both in terms of syntax and layout.

- Code:
  - Make sure it runs.
  - Make sure any dependency is listed and updated via a proper package manager.
  - Make sure to include the necessary tools and guides to run it properly.

- Resources:
   - TBD.
