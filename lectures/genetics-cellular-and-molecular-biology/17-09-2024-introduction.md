## What is life?

> All living things are built of cells, a cell is the smallest unit of living matter that can exist on its own.

- Ability to breathe, grow, reproduce etc. that people and animals and plants have before they die and that objects do not have.
- The condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional
  activity and continual change preceding death.

### The first principle of cellular theory
> The cell is the structural unit of life

**Life exists at increasing levels of complexity**:

- Cell
    - Structural unit of life
- Multicellular organisms
    - Individual consisting of interdependent cells
- Population
    - Group of individuals of the same species living in the same areas

## What is biology

Biology is the branch of science that deals with living organisms as objects of study

1. Cell biology/cytology: The study of cells
2. Molecular biology
3. The study of heredity and variation in the organism

### The cell theory (IMPORTANT):
1. The cell is the structural unit of life.
2. All living organisms are composed by one or more cells.
3. Cells originate by division of pre-existing cells.
<br>
4. Cells contain genetic information which resides in the DNA,
    such information is transimitted to daugther cells.

- **1944**: discover of genetic information stored in the DNA
- **1950**: Rules of base pairing outlined by Erwin Chargaff

### What are cells?
1. Cells are complex structures
2. Cells contain genetic information
3. Cells are capable of reproduction
4. Cells produce/acquire and use energy
6. Cells perform chemical reactions
