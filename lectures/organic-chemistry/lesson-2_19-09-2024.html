<h2 id="atomic-structure">Atomic Structure</h2>
<p><img alt="atomic structure" src="assets/atomic-struct.png" /></p>
<p>An atom consists of a nucleus at its center, which contains protons (positively charged) and neutrons (neutral).</p>
<p>Surrounding the nucleus are electrons (negatively charged), which move in regions called electron shells or orbitals. These shells represent different energy levels, with the electrons <strong>closest to the nucleus having lower energy</strong> and those <strong>further away having higher energy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Identity and behavior</strong>:
The number of protons defines the element, while the arrangement of electrons influences the atom's chemical behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Atomic number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mass number</p>
</li>
<li>The mass number is the number of protons plus neutrons in the nucleus
    <img alt="mass number" src="assets/mass-number.png" /></li>
</ul>
<p>The atomic weight of a particular element is the weighted average of the mass of all its isotopes reported in atomic
mass unit (amu).</p>
<ul>
<li>This difference in neutron count causes the isotopes to have different atomic masses (mass number = protons + neutrons), while still being the same element.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this particular reason the atomic mass of a given element is calculated as a weighted average.</p>
<p>💡 What is an isotope of a given element?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>An isotope of an element refers to atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons. This means that isotopes of an element have the same atomic number (same number of protons) but different mass numbers (total number of protons and neutrons). For example, carbon has two common isotopes: Carbon-12 (6 protons and 6 neutrons) and Carbon-14 (6 protons and 8 neutrons).</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="charged-ions">Charged ions</h3>
<p>An ion is an atom that has gained or lost one or more electrons, resulting in a net charge</p>
<ul>
<li>Cations</li>
<li>Ions with a positive because they have <strong>lost</strong> electons.</li>
<li>Anions</li>
<li>Ions with a negative charge because they have <strong>gained</strong> an electron.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="atomic-orbitals">Atomic Orbitals</h2>
<p>Atomic orbitals are regions around an atom's nucleus where there is a high probability of finding an electron. Orbitals are described by quantum mechanics and represent the wave-like behavior of electrons around the nucleus. Each orbital has a specific shape and energy level.</p>
<h3 id="s-orbital">S Orbital</h3>
<p><strong>s orbitals</strong> are spherical because the probability distribution of finding an electron is the same in every direction around the nucleus. This spherical symmetry results from the mathematical solutions to the Schrödinger equation for an electron in a hydrogen atom.</p>
<h3 id="p-orbitals">P Orbitals</h3>
<p><strong>p orbitals</strong> are a type of atomic orbital with a dumbbell or figure-eight shape, and they are more complex than s orbitals</p>
<p>An element presenting p orbitals arrangements is comprised of 3 p orbital, one for each 3-Dimensional axis repectively: Px, Py and Pz.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each p orbital has two lobes extending outwards starting from the nucleus, resembling a dumbbell shape.</li>
<li>These lobes represent regions where the probability of finding an electron is highest.</li>

<p>When electrons are placed singly in different orbitals of the same subshell, they will all have the same spin direction (either all up or all down).</p>

<h2 id="chemical-bonding">Chemical bonding</h2>
<p>In this context, <strong>bonding</strong> refers to the joining of two atoms in a stable arrangement. Through bonding, atoms gain, lose or share electrons to attain the electronic configuration of the noble gas closest to them in the periodic table.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 What is a noble gas?
<em>A noble gas is an element whose outermost energy level (also called "valence shell") is completely filled with electrons.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Atoms can either form ionic or covalent bonds to attain a complete outershell, e.g. seeking stability.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ionic bonds</strong> result from the transfer of an electron from one atom to another.</li>
<li><strong>Covalent bonds</strong> result from the sharing of electrons between two nuclei.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ionic-bonds">Ionic bonds</h3>
<p>These generally occur when elements from the far left side of the periodic table combine with elements from the far right side, ignoring noble gases.</p>
<p>A positively charged cation formed from the element on the left side attracts a negatively charged anion from the element right on side</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Why do <strong>Na</strong> and <strong>Cl</strong> keep staying close together after the ionic bonds (the electron was transferred), aren't they supposed to be stable and thus not needing to stay close?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great question! Let’s clarify why sodium (<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{Na}\)</span>) and chlorine (<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{Cl}\)</span>) still have opposite charges <strong>after</strong> the electron transfer. The key here lies in understanding how the electron transfer affects the <strong>total number of protons and electrons</strong> in each atom, and how this creates the charges.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="before-the-transfer">Before the Transfer:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sodium (Na)</strong>:</li>
<li>Atomic number = 11 (11 protons, which are positively charged).</li>
<li>It also has 11 electrons (negatively charged) in a neutral state.</li>
<li>In this state, sodium has <strong>no net charge</strong> because the <strong>positive protons</strong> and <strong>negative electrons</strong> cancel each other out.</li>
<li><strong>Chlorine (Cl)</strong>:</li>
<li>Atomic number = 17 (17 protons).</li>
<li>It also has 17 electrons in a neutral state.</li>
<li>Similarly, chlorine has <strong>no net charge</strong> because its positive and negative charges balance out.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="after-the-electron-transfer">After the Electron Transfer:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Sodium (Na)</strong> <strong>loses</strong> 1 electron:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now sodium has <strong>11 protons</strong> (still positively charged) but <strong>only 10 electrons</strong> (since it lost one electron).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means sodium has <strong>1 more proton</strong> than it has electrons. Since protons are positive, sodium becomes a <strong>positively charged ion</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{Na}^+\)</span>) because it now has an <strong>excess positive charge</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chlorine (Cl)</strong> <strong>gains</strong> 1 electron:</p>
</li>
<li>Chlorine has <strong>17 protons</strong> but now <strong>18 electrons</strong> (since it gained an electron from sodium).</li>
<li>This means chlorine has <strong>1 more electron</strong> than it has protons. Since electrons are negative, chlorine becomes a <strong>negatively charged ion</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{Cl}^-\)</span>) because it now has an <strong>excess negative charge</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-do-they-have-opposite-charges">Why Do They Have Opposite Charges?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sodium (<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{Na}^+\)</span>)</strong> becomes <strong>positively charged</strong> because it has <strong>more protons than electrons</strong> after losing one electron.</li>
<li><strong>Chlorine (<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{Cl}^-\)</span>)</strong> becomes <strong>negatively charged</strong> because it has <strong>more electrons than protons</strong> after gaining that electron.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the loss or gain of electrons directly results in an imbalance between protons (positive) and electrons (negative), creating these charges. Sodium is positive because it lost a negative electron, and chlorine is negative because it gained that electron.</p>
<h3 id="summary-of-the-charge-creation">Summary of the Charge Creation:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sodium (Na)</strong> loses 1 electron, leaving it with <strong>more protons than electrons</strong>, giving it a <strong>positive charge</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{Na}^+\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>Chlorine (Cl)</strong> gains 1 electron, leaving it with <strong>more electrons than protons</strong>, giving it a <strong>negative charge</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{Cl}^-\)</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>These opposite charges result in a <strong>strong electrostatic attraction</strong> between the <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{Na}^+\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{Cl}^-\)</span> ions, which forms the ionic bond.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="covalent-bonding">Covalent bonding</h3>
<p>Covalent bonding occurs with elements like carbon in the middle of the table with elements that have similar electronegativity.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a covalent bond, atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. Each atom contributes at least one electron to the bond and these electrons are shared <strong>equally</strong> or <strong>unequally</strong>, depending on the atoms involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Equally</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Electrons are shared <strong>equally</strong> between atoms with similar or identical electronegativities, resulting in no significant charge difference.<br />
<strong>Example</strong>: <strong>Hydrogen molecule <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{H}_2\)</span></strong> – Both hydrogen atoms share electrons equally because they have the same electronegativity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unequally</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Electrons are shared <strong>unequally</strong> between atoms with different electronegativities, causing partial charges on the atoms (δ− and δ+).<br />
<strong>Example</strong>: <strong>Water <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{H}_2\text{O}\)</span></strong> – Oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, leading to unequal sharing of electrons, with oxygen gaining a partial negative charge and hydrogen a partial positive charge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A covalent bond is a two-electron bond and a compound with covalent bonds is called a <strong>Molecule</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="concept-of-polarity">Concept of Polarity:</h3>
<p><strong>Polarity</strong> refers to the unequal sharing of electrons in a bond, leading to regions of slight positive and negative charge, creating a dipole. A bond or molecule is <strong>polar</strong> if it has such charge separation, while it is <strong>nonpolar</strong> if the electrons are evenly distributed.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Polar Bonds</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a <strong>polar covalent bond</strong>, one atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly than the other. This creates a <strong>dipole moment</strong>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>The atom that attracts electrons more strongly becomes slightly <strong>negative</strong> (partial negative charge, δ−).</li>
<li>The other atom becomes slightly <strong>positive</strong> (partial positive charge, δ+).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The bond is said to be <strong>polar</strong> because there is a separation of charge, creating "poles" (one positive, one negative).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: In water <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{H}_2\text{O}\)</span>, oxygen is more electronegative than hydrogen, so the electrons are pulled closer to oxygen, making oxygen δ− and hydrogen δ+.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Nonpolar Bonds</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a <strong>nonpolar covalent bond</strong>, the electrons are shared <strong>equally</strong> between the atoms, so there is <strong>no charge separation</strong> and no dipole moment.</p>
</li>
<li>These bonds occur between atoms with the same or very similar electronegativity.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: In a molecule of oxygen <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{O}_2\)</span>, both oxygen atoms share electrons equally, so the bond is nonpolar.</p>
<h3 id="polarity-in-molecules">Polarity in Molecules:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Polar molecules</strong>: Molecules with an overall charge separation due to polar bonds and an asymmetrical shape. Water <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{H}_2\text{O}\)</span> is polar because of its bent shape and polar bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Nonpolar molecules</strong>: Molecules where the bonds are either nonpolar, or polar bonds cancel out due to a symmetrical arrangement. <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{CO}_2\)</span> (carbon dioxide) is nonpolar because its linear shape causes the polar bonds to cancel each other out.</li>

<h3 id="valence-electrons">Valence electrons</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Octet Rule</strong>
  The octet rule states that atoms tend to form bonds in such a way that they achieve a total of 8 electrons in their outermost (valence) shell, which makes them chemically stable. This configuration mimics the electron arrangement of noble gases, which are naturally stable due to having a full outer shell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second row elements can have no more that eight electrons around them. For neutral molecules, this has two consequences:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Atoms with one, two, three or four valence electrons</strong> form one, two, three or four bonds, respectively in neutral molecules (e.g. <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{BF}_3\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{CH}_4\)</span>)</p>
<ul>
<li>In boron trifluoride <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{BF}_3\)</span>, each fluorine atom shares 1 electron with boron, completing fluorine’s octet and giving boron 3 shared electrons in its valence shell.</li>
<li>Fluorine has an atomic number of 9, meaning it has 9 electrons: 2 in the first energy level and 7 in the second (valence) shell.</li>
<li>The second shell can hold a maximum of 8 electrons, so fluorine is 1 electron short of completing its octet.</li>
<li>Boron is one of the exceptions to the octet rule, meaning it can form stable compounds with fewer than 8 electrons in its valence shell. In <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{BF}_3\)</span>, boron doesn't need a full octet to be chemically stable.</li>
<li>Atoms with 1–4 valence electrons form as many bonds as they have valence electrons because <strong>they only have that many electrons available to share</strong>. These atoms are "sharing" their valence electrons with other atoms to reach the octet rule, or 8 electrons in their outer shell.</li>
<li><strong>The number of bonds they can form is directly tied to the number of valence electrons they have to offer.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Atoms with five or more valence electrons</strong> form enough bonds to give an octet (e.g. <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{NH}_3\)</span>)</p>
<ul>
<li>In this case, the predicted number of bonds is given by = 8 - #{valence electrons}</li>
<li>These atoms (like nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine) are already close to 8 electrons in their valence shell.</li>
<li>Since they already have most of the electrons they need (5, 6, or 7), they are more reactive and eager to form bonds with other atoms to quickly complete their octet.</li>
<li>Oxygen, with <strong>6 valence electrons</strong>, needs <strong>2 more electrons</strong> to complete its octet. It easily achieves this by forming <strong>two covalent bonds</strong>, where each bond involves sharing one pair of electrons with another atom, allowing oxygen to reach the stable 8-electron configuration.</li>
<li>It is always possible for an element having &gt;= 5 valence electrons to reach the octet via covalent bonding.</li>

<h3 id="how-to-draw-lewis-structures">How to draw lewis structures</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Arrange atoms next to each other that you think are bonded together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always place Hydrogen and halogens on the periphery because they only form one bond each.
    <img alt="How to not bond Hs" src="assets/lewis-how-to-not-bond-H.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place no more atoms around an atom than the number of bonds it usually forms.
    <img alt="How to place elements correctly" src="assets/lewis-n-atoms-correct.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Count the electrons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Count the number of valence electrons from all atoms</p>
</li>
<li>Add one electron for each negative charge<ul>
<li>e.g. For <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{NO}_3^-\)</span> (nitrate ion) there is a -1 charge, so you add one additional electron to the total count.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subtract one electron for each positive charge<ul>
<li>e.g. For <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{NH}_4^+\)</span> (ammonium ion) there is a +1 charge, so you subtract one electron from the total count.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This gives the total number of electrons that must be used in drawing the Lewis structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Arrange the electrons around the atoms.</p>
</li>
<li>Place a bond between every two atoms, giving two electrons to each H and no more than eight to any second row atom.<ul>
<li>For each bond between atoms, place a single line (representing a pair of shared electrons).</li>
<li>Each hydrogen (H) should receive two electrons (a single bond), while atoms in the second row of the periodic table (like carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen) should not exceed eight electrons (the octet rule).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use all remaining electrons to fill octets with lone pairs.<ul>
<li>After placing bonds, assign any remaining electrons as lone pairs on the atoms to complete their octet.</li>
<li>Hydrogen atoms already have their 2 electrons from the single bond, so focus on completing the octets for the other atoms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If all valence electrons are used and atoms do not have an octet, form multiple bonds.</li>

<p>Some atoms are stable with fewer than 8 electrons in their valence shell. This is common for elements that have only a few valence electrons and are unable to to form enought bonds to react the octet.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>B</strong> (Boron): this element often forms compounds like <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{BF}_3\)</span> (boron trifluoride), where it only has 6 electrons in its valence shell, not 8. Boron is stable in this electron-deficient state.</li>

<ul>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(\text{NO}_2\)</span> (Nitrogen dioxide): Within this molecule, <strong>nitrogen</strong> has 5 valence electrons, and the molecule has a total of 17 electrons. This leaves on electron unpaired, making it radical.</li>

<h2 id="resonance-structures">Resonance structures</h2>
<p>Some molecules cannot be adequately represented by a single Lewis structure</p>
<p><img alt="Resonance structure example" src="assets/resonance-example.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>These structures are called <strong>resonance structures</strong> or <strong>resonance forms</strong>.</li>
<li>A double headed arrow is used to separate the two resonance structures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resonance structures</strong> are two Lewis structures having the same atoms placement but a different arrangement of electrons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Resonance structures are different possible Lewis structures for the same molecule that have the same arrangement of atoms but different distributions of electrons, particularly the location of double bonds or lone pairs.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="principles-of-resonance-theory">Principles of resonance theory</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resonance structures are not real</strong>: An individual resonance structure does not accurately represent the structure of a molecule or ion. Only the hybrid does.</li>
<li>Resonance structures are not in equilibrium with each other.</li>
<li>Resonance structures are not isomers: Two isomers differ in the arrangement of both atoms and electrons, whereas resonance structures differ only in the arrangement of electrons.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What really is resonance?</strong>
Resonance is the phenomenon where the true electronic structure of a molecule cannot be represented by just one Lewis structure. Instead, the real structure is a weighted average (or blend) of all possible resonance structures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Resonance helps stabilize molecules by allowing the electron density to be distributed over a larger area.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a resonance hybrid?</strong>
The resonance hybrid is the actual structure of the molecule that results from averaging all the possible resonance structures. It represents the delocalized electron distribution across the molecule.</p>

<p>Second-row elements (like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) cannot have more than 8 electrons in resonance structures because they follow the octet rule, which states that these elements can accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons in their valence shell. This is due to the fact that second-row elements have only the 2s and 2p orbitals, which can hold a total of 8 electrons (2 in the s orbital and 6 in the p orbitals).</p>

<p>In this image, two different scenarios are illustrated, one involving a <strong>positively charged carbon atom (carbocation)</strong> and the other involving a <strong>negatively charged carbon atom (carbanion)</strong>. The main point being shown is how adding a hydrogen atom affects the lone pair of electrons on these charged carbon atoms.</p>
<p><img alt="Carbocation, Carbanion examples" src="assets/carbonation.png" /></p>
<h3 id="top-scenario-positively-charged-carbon-carbocation">Top Scenario (positively charged carbon, carbocation):</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Carbocation</strong>: The carbon atom initially has a <strong>positive charge</strong>, meaning it has lost an electron, leaving it with only <strong>three bonds</strong> and no lone pair.</li>
<li><strong>Adding One Hydrogen Atom</strong>: When a hydrogen atom is added to the positively charged carbon, it forms a <strong>new bond</strong> between the carbon and hydrogen. However, since the carbon already had three bonds and no extra electrons (due to the positive charge), adding this bond <strong>does not create a lone pair</strong> on the carbon.</li>
<li>Result: <strong>No lone pair</strong> on the carbon, and it has a full valence of bonds.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="bottom-scenario-negatively-charged-carbon-carbanion">Bottom Scenario (negatively charged carbon, carbanion):</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Carbanion</strong>: In this case, the carbon atom has a <strong>negative charge</strong>, meaning it has an extra electron (in addition to its usual four valence electrons). This extra electron sits as a <strong>lone pair</strong> on the carbon.</li>
<li><strong>Adding One Hydrogen Atom</strong>: When a hydrogen atom is added to the negatively charged carbon, a new bond forms between the carbon and the hydrogen. Now, the carbon still has one <strong>lone pair of electrons</strong> left after the bond forms because it originally had five valence electrons (four from carbon and one from the negative charge).</li>
<li>Result: <strong>One lone pair</strong> remains on the carbon, as shown by the two dots.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="electron-count-in-carbon">Electron Count in Carbon</h4>
<ul>
<li>A neutral carbon atom has <strong>4 valence electrons</strong>.</li>
<li>In the methyl anion <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{CH}_3^-\)</span>, the carbon atom gains <strong>one additional electron</strong> due to the negative charge, bringing the total number of valence electrons on carbon to <strong>5</strong>.</li>
<li>The additional electron in the methyl anion comes from outside the molecule, typically provided by a reducing agent or from the surrounding environment in a chemical reaction.</li>
<li>This is how anions generally form: <strong><em>by gaining an extra electron</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bonding-with-hydrogens">Bonding with Hydrogens</h4>
<ul>
<li>The carbon in <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{CH}_3^-\)</span> forms <strong>three single bonds</strong> with three hydrogen atoms. Each of these bonds involves sharing one electron from carbon and one electron from hydrogen.</li>
<li>After forming these bonds, <strong>3 of the 5 valence electrons</strong> from carbon are involved in bonding.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="remaining-electrons-lone-pair">Remaining Electrons (Lone Pair)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Carbon now has <strong>2 remaining electrons</strong> after forming the three bonds.</li>
<li>These 2 remaining electrons are not involved in any bonding, so they form a <strong>lone pair</strong> of electrons.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-not-just-one-electron">Why not just one electron?</h3>
<ul>
<li>If there were only <strong>one</strong> non-bonding electron left, the molecule would be a <strong>radical</strong>, not an anion. But in the case of <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{CH}_3^-\)</span>, we have a complete <strong>pair</strong> of non-bonding electrons (2 electrons), which gives the carbon atom its negative charge.</li>
<li>A lone pair always consists of <strong>two electrons</strong> because electrons pair up due to their spin, and these two non-bonding electrons stay together as a lone pair.</li>

<p><img alt="Bond length increase" src="assets/bond-length-increase.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Bond lengths decrease across a row of the periodic table as the size of the atom decreases. This trend occurs because <strong>atoms get smaller as you move from left to right</strong> across a period due to an increase in the effective nuclear charge.</li>
<li>As <strong>more protons</strong> are added to the nucleus, the <strong>electrons are pulled closer</strong>, resulting in a smaller atomic radius.</li>
<li>When atoms are <strong>smaller</strong>, their nuclei are <strong>closer together</strong> in a bond, leading to a shorter bond length. Additionally, as atomic size decreases, the bond strength tends to increase because the overlapping atomic orbitals are more <strong>tightly bound</strong> due to the <strong>smaller size</strong> and <strong>greater effective nuclear charge</strong>, further contributing to a shorter bond length.</li>
<li>For example, in a period, the bond length of carbon-carbon bonds is shorter than that of boron-boron bonds because carbon is to the right of boron and has a smaller atomic radius.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bond-length-increases-down-a-column-of-the-periodic-table-as-the-size-of-an-atom-increases">Bond length increases down a column of the periodic table as the size of an atom increases</h4>
<p><img alt="Bond length increase column" src="assets/bond-length-increase-column.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As you move down a group in the periodic table, <strong>atoms have more electron shells</strong>, and the <strong>outermost electrons are farther from the nucleus</strong>. This results in a <strong>larger atomic radius</strong>. When atoms are larger, the nuclei are farther apart in a bond, leading to a longer bond length.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the electrons in the outermost shells experience more <strong>shielding</strong> from inner electrons, the effective nuclear charge is lower, further contributing to the increase in atomic size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, in Group 17 (the halogens), the bond length of a hydrogen-fluorine (H-F) bond is shorter than that of a hydrogen-iodine (H-I) bond. This is because iodine is much larger than fluorine, and thus, the bond length increases as the size of the iodine atom increases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 <strong>What is the shielding effect?</strong>
A fenomenon in which ih the inner electrons between the nucleus and the outer (valence) electrons act as a "shield." These inner electrons repel the outer electrons due to their negative charge, reducing the full attractive force exerted by the positively charged nucleus on the valence electrons. As a result, the outer electrons experience a weaker effective nuclear charge (the net positive charge felt by the electrons) than they would if the inner electrons were not present.</p>

<p>The <strong>geometry of a molecule</strong> is determined by the number of "groups" around a central atom. A <strong>group</strong> can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>atom</strong> bonded to the central atom</li>
<li>A <strong>lone pair of electrons</strong> that the central atom possesses</li>
</ul>
<p>The arrangement of these groups around the central atom aims to <strong>minimize repulsion</strong> between them, which leads to a stable geometry. This concept is the foundation of <strong>Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theory states that the electron pairs (bonding pairs and lone pairs) surrounding an atom will position themselves as far apart as possible to minimize repulsion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This helps determine the shape (geometry) of the molecule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Types of Geometries</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linear</strong> (180° bond angle):</p>
<ul>
<li>Occurs when there are <strong>two groups</strong> around the central atom.</li>
<li>Example: Carbon dioxide (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CO2}\)</span>) has two oxygen atoms bonded to the carbon atom, resulting in a linear shape.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trigonal Planar</strong> (120° bond angle):</p>
<ul>
<li>Happens when there are <strong>three groups</strong> around the central atom.</li>
<li>Example: Boron trifluoride ( <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{BF3}\)</span> ), where three fluorine atoms are bonded to boron in a flat triangle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tetrahedral</strong> (109.5° bond angle):</p>
<ul>
<li>This shape forms when there are <strong>four groups</strong> around the central atom.</li>
<li>Example: Methane (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH4}\)</span>), where four hydrogen atoms are arranged symmetrically around a carbon atom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Effect of Lone Pairs:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Lone pairs take up more space than bonding pairs because they are closer to the nucleus. As a result, the presence of lone pairs slightly reduces bond angles.</li>
<li>For example, water (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H2O}\)</span>) has a tetrahedral electron geometry, but because of two lone pairs on the oxygen atom, the bond angle is reduced from 109.5° to around 104.5°, giving the molecule a bent shape.</li>

<p>The image on the left shows the <strong>tetrahedral geometry</strong> of methane ( <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH4}\)</span>) with bond angles of <strong>109.5°</strong>, which is the preferred arrangement for four groups around a central atom like carbon.</p>
<ul>
<li>The tetrahedral geometry is predicted by <strong>Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory</strong>, which states that electron pairs (bonding and lone pairs) will arrange themselves as far apart as possible to minimize repulsion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The image on the right shows a <strong>square planar arrangement</strong> with bond angles of <strong>90°</strong>, which does not occur in methane or similar molecules with four groups around the central atom. This is because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Electron Repulsion</strong>: A square planar arrangement forces the bonding groups (hydrogen atoms) closer together, resulting in bond angles of 90°. This creates much more repulsion between the bonding pairs of electrons, as they are not as far apart as they could be. VSEPR theory predicts that atoms and electron pairs will arrange themselves in a way that minimizes this repulsion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tetrahedral Geometry</strong>: In a tetrahedral geometry (left), the bond angles of 109.5° are much larger than 90°, allowing for less repulsion between the bonding groups. The tetrahedral arrangement is the most stable configuration for four groups around a central atom like carbon because it maximizes the distance between the groups.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The square planar arrangement in the right-hand image is not observed because it would lead to significantly greater electron repulsion, making the molecule less stable.</p>

<p>To account for the bonding patterns observed in more complext molecules, we must take a closer look at how the second ring orbitals of atoms in the second row are being used.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to its two core electrons, carbon has 4 valence electrons.</li>
<li>In its <strong>ground state</strong>, carbon places it's valence electrons in the following manner:</li>
<li>2 electrons in the 2s orbital</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The term <strong><em>"isolated"</em></strong> refers to the ability to separate and maintain a chemical species in a pure, stable form under standard laboratory conditions. When a molecule or compound is said to be "isolated," it means that it can exist on its own without rapidly reacting or decomposing, and it can be studied independently.

However, <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH2}\)</span> is highly reactive because <strong>it lacks a full octet</strong>, making it very unstable. As a result, it cannot be isolated under typical conditions as it <strong>reacts almost immediately with other molecules or atoms in an attempt to achieve stability</strong> (e.g. forming more bonds to complete its octet). This inability to be isolated means that the <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH2}\)</span> species can't be bottled or handled easily as a stable, stand-alone molecule in the lab.</p>

<li><strong>sp Hybridization in Acetylene (HC≡CH)</strong>:</li>
<li>In acetylene, each carbon atom is <strong>sp hybridized</strong>.</li>
<li>
<p>This means that each carbon has two sp hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized <strong>p</strong> orbitals (one along the <strong>py</strong> axis and one along the <strong>pz</strong> axis).</p>

<h4 id="acetylene-cec2h2">Acetylene <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C2H2}\)</span></h4>
<p><a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6325#section=3D-Conformer">3D structure</a></p>
<p>In acetylene (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{HC#CH}\)</span>), each carbon atom undergoes <strong>sp hybridization</strong>. This means that one <strong>s orbital</strong> and one <strong>p orbital</strong> from each carbon atom combine to form two sp hybrid orbitals. These sp orbitals are oriented linearly, giving a bond angle of <strong>180°</strong>, which explains the linear geometry of the molecule.</p>
<p>Each carbon atom in acetylene also retains two unhybridized <strong>2p orbitals</strong>. These orbitals are oriented <strong>perpendicular to each other</strong> and to the sp hybrid orbitals. The sp hybrid orbitals are used to form <strong>sigma (σ) bonds</strong>: one between each carbon atom and a hydrogen atom and one between the two carbon atoms.</p>
<h3 id="triple-bonds">Triple Bonds</h3>
<p>The <strong>triple bond</strong> between the two carbon atoms in acetylene consists of:
- <strong>One <span class="arithmatex">\(\sigma\)</span> bond</strong>: This bond is formed by the head-on overlap of two sp hybrid orbitals, one from each carbon atom.
- <strong>Two <span class="arithmatex">\(\pi\)</span> bonds</strong>: The two unhybridized 2p orbitals on each carbon atom overlap <strong>side-by-side</strong> with the corresponding 2p orbitals on the other carbon atom. These side-by-side overlaps create two pi bonds. One pi bond is formed from the overlap of the p orbitals along the <strong>y-axis</strong>, and the other from the overlap of the p orbitals along the <strong>z-axis</strong>.</p>
<p>The result is a strong triple bond that consists of:
1. <strong>One <span class="arithmatex">\(\sigma\)</span> bond</strong> that aligns along the internuclear axis.
2. <strong>Two <span class="arithmatex">\(\pi\)</span> bonds</strong> that are perpendicular to the sigma bond and each other, giving the molecule its rigidity and preventing free rotation around the triple bond.</p>
<h4 id="properties-of-triple-bonds">Properties of Triple Bonds</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strength</strong>: Triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double or single bonds because they involve more overlapping electron density between the bonded atoms.</li>
<li><strong>Bond Length</strong>: The bond length in acetylene is shorter than in compounds with double or single bonds due to the increased overlap from the <span class="arithmatex">\(\pi\)</span> bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Rigidity</strong>: The presence of two <span class="arithmatex">\(\pi\)</span> bonds in a triple bond restricts rotation around the bond axis, making the molecule more rigid than alkenes (with double bonds) or alkanes (with single bonds).</li>

<li>A <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C-C}\)</span> bond is <strong>nonpolar</strong>.</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C-H}\)</span>bonds are considered to be nonpolar because the electronegativity difference between<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C}\)</span>and<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H}\)</span> is small.</li>

<h3 id="essential-polarity-rules">Essential polarity rules</h3>
<h3 id="rules">Rules:</h3>
<ol>
<li>If the electronegativity difference (<span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta EN\)</span>) is less than 0.5, the bond is <strong>nonpolar covalent</strong>.</li>
<li>If the <span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta EN\)</span> is between 0.5 and 1.6, the bond is considered <strong>polar covalent</strong>.</li>
<li>If the <span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta EN\)</span> is greater than 2.0, the bond is <strong>ionic</strong>.</li>
<li>If the <span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta EN\)</span> is between 1.6 and 2.0:</li>
<li><strong>If a metal is involved</strong>, the bond is considered <strong>ionic</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>If only nonmetals are involved</strong>, the bond is considered <strong>polar covalent</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example">Example:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sodium bromide</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{NaBr}\)</span>; <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{EN_{Na}} = 0.9\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{EN_{Br}} = 2.8\)</span>): <span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta EN = 1.9\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Hydrogen fluoride</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{HF}\)</span>; <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{EN_{H}} = 2.1\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{EN_{F}} = 4.0\)</span>): <span class="arithmatex">\(\Delta EN = 1.9\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rule 4</strong> applies: 
- <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{NaBr}\)</span> has <strong>ionic bonds</strong> because it involves a metal (Na).
- <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{HF}\)</span> has a <strong>polar covalent bond</strong> because both atoms are nonmetals.</p>
<p>These two compounds are quite different:
- <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{NaBr}\)</span> exhibits the classic <strong>lattice structure</strong> typical of ionic substances.
- <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{HF}\)</span> is a <strong>gas</strong> at room temperature, reflecting the nature of polar covalent bonds.</p></div>
