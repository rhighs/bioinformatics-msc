<h2 id="what-is-an-acid">What is an acid?</h2>
<p>An acid in its broad sense, is a substance that can donate proton (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H^+}\)</span> ions) or accept electron pairs.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-base">What is a base?</h2>
<p>Depending on the definition, a base contrary to an acid: is a protons acceptor or can donate electron pairs.</p>

<ul>
<li>A hydrogen without its only electron is called a <strong><em>"proton"</em></strong></li>
<li>A Brønsted-Lowry acid is a proton donor; it must have a proton.</li>
<li>A Brønsted-Lowry base is a proton acceptor; it must be able to form a bond to a proton.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reactions-of-brnsted-lowry-acids-and-bases">Reactions of Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Brønsted-Lowry acid base reaction results in the transfer of a proton from an acid to a base</li>
<li>The electron pair of the base <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{B:}\)</span> forms a new bond to the proton of the acid</li>
<li>The acid <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H-A}\)</span>loses a proton, leaving the electron pair in the<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H-A}\)</span>bond on<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{A}\)</span>. This forms the conjugate base of the acid.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/acid-base-reaction.png" /></p>
<p>The double reaction arrow notation (equilibrium) is used between starting materials and products to indicate that the reaction can proceed in both directions.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>conjugate base</strong> is what remains of the acidic part that was altered after losing it's proton</li>
<li>
<p>Similalrly, a <strong>conjugate acid</strong> is what you obtain by bonding the lost proton the the basic compound, (simply, it is formed when the base gains a proton).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acid</strong> <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{HA}\)</span> donates a proton, forming:
  $$
  \text{HA} \rightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{A}^-
  $$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(\text{HA}\)</span> is the <strong>acid</strong>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{A}^-\)</span> is the <strong>conjugate base</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Base</strong> <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{B}\)</span> accepts a proton, forming:
  $$
  \text{B} + \text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{BH}^+
  $$</p>
</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(\text{B}\)</span> is the <strong>base</strong>, and <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{BH}^+\)</span> is the <strong>conjugate acid</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In reactions, the movement of electrons can be illustrated using <strong>curved arrow</strong> notation. Because two electron pairs are involved in this reaction below two arrows are needed.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/acid-base-curved-arrow.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>When <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{NH2^-}\)</span>reacts with<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H2O}\)</span>, the amide ion will abstract a proton proton <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H^+}\)</span> from water.</li>
<li>The <strong>proton (H⁺)</strong> from water, which is accepted by the nitrogen in ammonia.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-actually-happens">What actually happens</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen</strong> in <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{NH2^-}\)</span> is used to form a bond with the proton (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H^+}\)</span>) from water.</li>

<p>Acid strength is the tendency of an acid to donate a proton. The more readily a compound donates a proton, the stronger an acid is.</p>

<h4 id="why-water-acts-as-a-base-in-this-reaction">Why water acts as a base in this reaction</h4>
<p>In this particular case, <strong>H-A</strong> is a stronger acid than water. Water, with its lone pair of electrons on oxygen, can accept a proton, acting as a base. The proton (H⁺) is transferred from <strong>H-A</strong> to water, forming the hydronium ion (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H3O^+}\)</span>) and the conjugate base (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{A^-}\)</span>).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:
This ability of being both an acid or a base depending on the context is known as being <strong>amphoteric</strong>. In the example from the image, water is acting as a <strong>base</strong>, but it can also act as an acid in other situations.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-solvent">What is a solvent?</h4>

<li>A solvent is a substance that dissolves other substances (called solutes) to form a solution.</li>
<li>Water (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H2O}\)</span>) is a very common solvent in many chemical reactions, including acid-base reactions, due to its polarity and ability to dissolve many substances. In the reaction above between an acid (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H-A}\)</span>) and water in the image, water is acting as the solvent because it provides the medium in which the reaction occurs.</li>

<h3 id="factors-that-determine-acid-strength">Factors that determine acid strength</h3>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Anything that stabilizes a conjugate base <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{(A:)^-}\)</span>make the starting acid<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H-A}\)</span> more acidic.</p>
<p>Four factors affect the acidity of <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H-A}\)</span>. These are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Element Effects</strong>: The identity of the atom directly bonded to the acidic hydrogen significantly affects acidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Across a period (left to right), electronegativity increases, so a more electronegative atom stabilizes the negative charge on A⁻ better, leading to a stronger acid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Down a group, the size of the atom increases, and larger atoms can better accommodate the negative charge, also making the acid stronger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inductive Effects</strong>: Electronegative atoms or groups attached to the molecule can withdraw electron density through sigma bonds (induction), helping to stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base. This effect decreases with distance from the acidic site, but the presence of electronegative atoms like fluorine can still increase acidity by stabilizing the conjugate base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resonance Effects</strong>: If the conjugate base <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{A^-}\)</span> has resonance structures that delocalize the negative charge over multiple atoms, the conjugate base is more stable, which increases the acidity of the starting acid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, carboxylic acids are more acidic than alcohols because the conjugate base (carboxylate) is stabilized by resonance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hybridization Effects</strong>: The hybridization of the atom bonded to the acidic hydrogen affects acidity.</p>
</li>
<li>More s-character in the hybrid orbitals increases acidity because a higher s-character means the electrons are held closer to the nucleus, stabilizing the negative charge on the conjugate base. For example, <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{sp}\)</span>-hybridized carbon (as in alkynes) is more acidic than <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{sp}^2\)</span>(alkenes) or<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{sp}^3\)</span> (alkanes) hybridized carbon.</li>
</ol>

<p>Why does H2O have a much lower pKa than CH4?</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/h2o-stronger-acid-than-ch4.png" /></p>
<p>Easy <span class="arithmatex">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> since oxygen is much more electronegative than carbon, it more readily accepts a negative charge.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/increasing-electronegativity.png" /></p>
<p>Yes, across a row of the periodic table, the acidity of H–A increases as the electronegativity of the atom <strong>A</strong> increases. This trend occurs because more electronegative atoms stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base (A⁻) better after the acid (H–A) donates a proton (H⁺). A more stable conjugate base makes it easier for the acid to lose its proton, thus increasing the acidity.</p>
<h4 id="trend-of-electronegativity-across-a-period">Trend of electronegativity across a period</h4>
<p>As you move <strong>from left to right across a row</strong> of the periodic table, the electronegativity of the atoms increases. This is due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increasing nuclear charge</strong>: As the atomic number increases across a period, the number of protons in the nucleus also increases. This pulls the electrons more strongly towards the nucleus, increasing electronegativity.</li>
<li><strong>Smaller atomic radius</strong>: Moving from left to right across a period also leads to a decrease in atomic radius (since electrons are added to the same shell but the nucleus pulls them closer), which further enhances the atom's ability to attract electrons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Electronegativity values are often reported using the <strong>Pauling scale</strong>, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>.</p>
<h4 id="general-electronegativity-trends-on-the-periodic-table">General electronegativity trends on the periodic table</h4>
<ul>
<li>The most electronegative elements are found at the top right of the periodic table (excluding the noble gases), with <strong>fluorine</strong> being the most electronegative element.</li>
<li><strong>Metals</strong> on the left side of the periodic table (like sodium, potassium) have very low electronegativity because they tend to lose electrons easily.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-electronegativity-relates-to-acidity">How electronegativity relates to acidity</h4>
<ul>
<li>As <strong>electronegativity of A increases</strong>, the ability of A to stabilize the negative charge on A⁻ increases after the loss of a proton. This makes the acid (H–A) stronger.</li>
<li>For example, across the period from <strong>C</strong> (in CH₄) to <strong>N</strong> (in NH₃) to <strong>O</strong> (in H₂O) to <strong>F</strong> (in HF), the acidity of H–A increases dramatically because the conjugate bases become more stabilized due to the increasing electronegativity of A.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-little-side-note-on-calculating-electronegativity">A little side note on calculating electronegativity</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pauling's approach</strong>: Pauling calculated electronegativity using bond dissociation energies between different atoms. Moreover, the difference in electronegativity between two atoms can be inferred from the bond energy difference between a heteronuclear bond (A–B) and the average of the homonuclear bonds (A–A and B–B).</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="assets/bigger-more-stable.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Down a column of the periodic table</strong>, the <strong>size of the atom</strong> becomes the dominant factor in determining acidity, not electronegativity. Larger atoms can better stabilize the negative charge on the conjugate base because the charge is spread over a greater volume.</li>
<li><strong>Charge stabilization</strong>: Positive or negative charge is more stable when it is spread over a larger area or volume. For larger atoms, the negative charge on the conjugate base is distributed over a greater space, reducing charge density and making the conjugate base more stable.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/bigger-more-acidic.png" /></p>
<h3 id="inductive-effects">Inductive effects</h3>
<ul>
<li>An inductive effect is the pull of electron density through <span class="arithmatex">\(\sigma\)</span> bonds caused by electronegativity differences of atoms.</li>
<li>More electronegative atoms stabilize regions of high electron density by an electron withdrawing inductive effect, basically pulling electrons closer to them.</li>
<li>The more electronegative the atom and the closer it is to the site of the negative charge <span class="arithmatex">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> the greater the effect.</li>
<li>The acidity of <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H-A}\)</span> increases with the presence of electron withdrawing groups in A.</li>

<p><img alt="" src="assets/ethanol-trifluoroethanol-acidity.png" /></p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> This is because the three electronegative fluorine atoms stabilize the negatively charged conjugate base.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="assets/trifluoroethanol-polarity.png" /></p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CF3}\)</span> is polarized creating a pulling force towards its center from the methylene group, ultimately making the alcohol tail more prone to give away it's proton. This is the reason why <strong>trifluoroethanol</strong> is more acidic than plain ethanol.</p>
<h3 id="resonance-effects">Resonance effects</h3>
<p>Delocalization of charge through resonance influences acidity. Acetic acid is more acidic than ethanol, even though both conjugate bases have the negative charge on the same element, <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{O}\)</span>.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Acetic Acid <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3COOH}\)</span>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When acetic acid donates a proton (H⁺), it forms the acetate ion <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3COO^-}\)</span> as its conjugate base.</p>

<li>The negative charge on the oxygen in the acetate ion is <strong>delocalized</strong> through <strong>resonance</strong>. There are two resonance structures in which the negative charge is shared equally between the two oxygen atoms.
     $$

</ol>
<p>This <strong>delocalization of the negative charge</strong> over both oxygen atoms stabilizes the conjugate base (acetate ion) significantly.</p>

<li>
<p>Ethanol <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3CH2OH}\)</span>:</p>

</ol>
<p>Structure of ethoxide ion:

   $$
   The negative charge is concentrated on a single oxygen atom, making the ethoxide ion less stable compared to the acetate ion.</p>

<p>A lewis base is an electron pair donor. Lewis bases are structurally the same as Brønsted-Lowry bases. Both have an available electron pair:
- A lone pair
- An electron pair in a <span class="arithmatex">\(\pi\)</span> bond
    -  The <span class="arithmatex">\(\pi\)</span>bonds have <strong>electron density above and below</strong> the axis connecting the nuclei of the bonded atoms. These electrons in the<span class="arithmatex">\(\pi\)</span>bond are less tightly held than those in a<span class="arithmatex">\(\sigma\)</span> bond, making them more reactive and available for donation in chemical reactions.</p>
<p>A Brønsted-Lowry base always donates an electron pair to a proton, but a Lewis base donates it to anything that is <strong>electron deficient</strong>.</p>
<p>Generally, this rule is applied</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
    \text{Brønsted-Lowry base} \Rightarrow \text{Lewis base}
\]</div>
<p>but not the opposite</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
    \text{Brønsted-Lowry base} \space \cancel{\Leftarrow} \space \text{Lewis base}
\]</div>
<p>Being a Brønsted-Lowry base implies being a Lewis base, but this does not hold true for the opposite. This is because a Brønsted-Lowry specifically involves a proton transfer. Specifically, they <strong>accept a proton</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="lewis-acids">Lewis acids</h3>
<ul>
<li>A lewis acid is an electron pair acceptor <span class="arithmatex">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> any species that is electron deficient and capable of <strong>accepting an electron pair is also a Lewis acid</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like before, being a Brønsted-Lowry acid implies being a Lewis acid, but the opposite is not necessarily true. Thus:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
    \text{Brønsted-Lowry acid} \Rightarrow \text{Lewis acid}
\]</div>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
    \text{Brønsted-Lowry acid} \space \cancel{\Leftarrow} \space \text{Lewis acid}
\]</div>
<ul>
<li>Common Lewis acids contain elements from the <strong>Group 3A</strong> because they do <strong>NOT</strong> posses a filled valence shell.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lewis-acid-base-reactions">Lewis acid-base reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a Lewis acid-base reaction, a Lewis base donates an electron pair to a Lewis acid. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/lewis-acid-with-water.png" /></p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: boron is electro deficient, it really wants that pair of electrons.</p>
<p>For example, in the reaction of <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{BF3}\)</span>(Boron Trifluoride) with<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H2O}\)</span>, the latter donates an electron pair to <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{BF3}\)</span>to form a new bond. Creating a polarity in the<span class="arithmatex">\(\sigma\)</span>bond leaving the exygen slight<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{+}\)</span>and the Boron slightly<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{-}\)</span> having gained one extra electron.</p>
<p>Great observation! The negative charge on boron in the image represents the <strong>formal charge</strong> after the formation of the coordinate covalent bond with the oxygen from water.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reaction with Water</strong>:</li>
<li>
<p>Water, acting as a Lewis base, donates a lone pair from the oxygen to boron. This forms a <strong>coordinate covalent bond</strong>, where both electrons in the bond come from oxygen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Formal Charge in Boron after the reaction</strong>:
   The formal charge on an atom can be calculated using this formula:
   $$
   \text{Formal charge} = \text{Valence electrons} - \left(\frac{\text{bonding electrons}}{2} + \text{non-bonding electrons}\right)
   $$</p>
</li>
<li>Boron has 3 valence electrons (group 13 element).</li>
<li>Bonding electrons include all those that are part of a bond, e.g. each single bond with Fluorine contributes with two electrons as well as the bond with oxygen.
     $$
     \text{Formal charge on boron} = 3 - \left(\frac{8}{2} + 0\right) = 3 - 4 = -1
     $$</li>
<li>Thus, boron gains a <strong>formal negative charge of (-1)</strong> because it is now "assigned" one more electron than it originally had in its neutral state.<ul>
<li><strong>NOTE</strong>: This <strong>does not</strong> mean that boron is negatively charged in the sense of gaining an actual electron, but rather that in the context of formal charges, it has "access" to one more electron than expected based on its original number of valence electrons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/BF3-vacant-p-orbital.png" /></p>
<p>The vacancy in the unhybridized p orbital is crucial to understanding why <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{BF3}\)</span> is a Lewis acid. Because boron is electron-deficient, it can accept a pair of electrons into this empty p orbital.</p>
<h3 id="elecrophiles-and-nuclephiles">Elecrophiles and Nuclephiles</h3>
<p>The general pattern of Lewis acid-base reaction is about electron-rich species interating with electron-poor ones. A lewis acid is also called an <strong>electrophile</strong>. When a lewis base interacts with an electrophile that is not a proton, the base is called a <strong>nucleophile</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{BF3} \rightarrow\)</span> electrophile</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H2O} \rightarrow\)</span> nucleophile</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lewis-acid-base-reations-forming-a-new-covalent-bond">Lewis acid-base reations forming a new covalent bond</h3>
<p>The electron pair from the Lewis base is used to form a new covalent bond with the Lewis acid, and this results in the formation of a <strong>Lewis acid-base complex</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/lewis-acid-base-reaction-covalent-bond.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>In some Lewis acid-base reactions, one bond is <strong>formed</strong> and one bond is <strong>broken</strong>.<ul>
<li><strong>Identify</strong> the Lewis acid and base first.</li>
<li>The <strong>Lewis acid</strong> is the electron pair <strong>acceptor</strong> (usually electron-deficient).</li>
<li>The <strong>Lewis base</strong> is the electron pair <strong>donor</strong> (usually with a lone pair of electrons).</li>
<li><strong>Draw a curved arrow</strong> from the electron pair of the base to the electron-deficient atom of the acid.</li>
<li>This arrow shows the <strong>movement of electrons</strong> from the base to the acid, forming a new bond.</li>
<li><strong>Count</strong> electron pairs and break a bond when needed to keep the correct number of valence electrons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In reactions where a bond must be broken to avoid exceeding the octet rule, ensure you adjust the bonding and lone pairs accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alkene-cehcl-reaction">Alkene-<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{HCl}\)</span> reaction</h3>
<p>The reaction between cyclohexene and HCl can be treated as a Lewis acid-base interaction. <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{HCl}\)</span>acts as the Lewis acid, and <strong>cyclohexene</strong> (having a<span class="arithmatex">\(\pi\)</span> bond) is the <strong>Lewis base</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/cyclohexene-hcl.png" /></p>
<p>The electron pair in the <span class="arithmatex">\(\pi\)</span>bond of the Lewis base forms a new bond to the proton of the Lewis acid, generating a carbocation. The<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H-Cl}\)</span>bond must break, giving its two electrons to<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{Cl}\)</span>, forming <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{Cl^-}\)</span>. Because two electron pairs are involved two curved arrows are used below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="assets/cyclohexene-hcl-reaction.png" /></p>
<h4 id="why-does-cyclohexene-break-its-double-bond">Why does cyclohexene break its double bond?</h4>
<p>Cyclohexene breaks its double bond during the reaction with HCl because the π bond electrons are loosely held and reactive, not because cyclohexene is electron-deficient to begin with. The reason for the double bond breaking lies in the reactivity of the π bond in the presence of an electrophile.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: in the reaction of cyclohexene with <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{HCl}\)</span>, the single bond with the proton could happen at any of the two ends of the double bond since the result would be the same.</p>
<h4 id="why-does-chlorine-does-not-follow-the-hydrogen-in-the-bonding">Why does Chlorine does not follow the hydrogen in the bonding?</h4>
<p>Chlorine does not follow hydrogen in the bonding because it is <strong>highly electronegative</strong> and prefers to keep the electrons for itself. When cyclohexene donates electrons to the proton (<strong>H⁺</strong>), the <strong>H-Cl bond polarizes further</strong>, pulling the bonding electrons towards chlorine. Since chlorine is already stable as <strong>Cl⁻</strong> (with a full octet), it <strong>rejects further bonding</strong> and releases the proton, breaking the bond.</p></div>
