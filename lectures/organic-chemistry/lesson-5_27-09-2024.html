<h2 id="tetrahedral-geometry-of-carbon">Tetrahedral geometry of Carbon</h2>
<p>All C atoms in an alkane are surrounded by four groups, making them <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{sp^3}\)</span>hybridized and tetrahedral, with all bond angles of<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{109.5°}\)</span>. The 3D representation and ball-stick models for these alkanes indicate the tetrahedral geometry around each <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C}\)</span> atom.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/methane-ethane.png" width=400 />
</p>

<p>In contrast, the Lewis structures are not meant to imply any 3D arrangement.</p>
<h2 id="drawing-compounds">Drawing compounds</h2>
<p>The three-carbon alkane <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3CH2CH3}\)</span>aka propane has a moleculer formula<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C3H8}\)</span>. In the 3D representation, each <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C}\)</span> atom has two bonds in the plane, one in bond front and one bond behind.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/propane-representation.png" width=400 />
</p>

<p>The five-carbon alkane <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3}\)</span>called pentane, has mol formula<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C5H12}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The carbon skeleton for pentane can be drawn in a variety of ways really, each of the following representations has five carbons in a row and represents pentane (not an isomer of pentane).</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/representations-of-pentane.png" width=500 />
</p>

<h2 id="constitutional-isomers">Constitutional isomers</h2>
<p>There are two different ways to arrange four carbons, giving two compounds with molecular formula <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C4H10}\)</span>, named butane and isobutane. Butane and isobutane are constitutional isomers—two different compounds with the same molecular formula. Constitutional isomers (also called structural isomers) differ in the way the atoms are connected to each other</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/butane-isobutane.png" width=500 />
</p>

<p>Butane is an example of a straight-chain alkane, while isobutane is a branched-chain alkane. This difference in structure influences their boiling points, melting points, and how they interact in chemical reactions.</p>

<p>Cycloalkanes have a molecular formula of <span class="arithmatex">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C_nH_2_n}\)</span> and contain carbon atoms arranged in a ring. Simple cycloalkanes are named by adding the prefix <em>cyclo-</em> to the name of the acyclic alkane having the same number of carbons.</p>

<p>The name of every organic molecule has 3 parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>parent</strong> name indicates the number of carbons in the longest continuous chain.</li>
<li>The <strong>suffix</strong> indicates what functional group is present.</li>
<li>The <strong>prefix</strong> tells us the identity, location, and number of substituents attached to the carbon chain.</li>
</ol>
<div class="arithmatex">\[

<li><strong>Suffix:</strong> What is the functional group?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: substituents are atoms or groups of atoms that replace one or more hydrogen atoms attached to the main carbon chain (or parent structure) of a molecule. They modify the basic structure of the molecule and can significantly influence its chemical properties, reactivity, and naming.</p>
<h3 id="naming-substituents-alkyl-groups">Naming substituents -Alkyl groups</h3>
<p>Carbon substituents bonded to a long carbon chain are called <strong>alkyl groups</strong>. An alkyl group is formed by removing one H atom from an alkane.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="naming-three-alkyl-groups">Naming three alkyl groups</h3>
<p>Naming three or four alkyl groups is more complicated because the parent <em>hydrocarbons</em> have more than one type of hydrogen atom. For example, consider propane: it has both 1 degree and 2 degrees <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H}\)</span>atoms and removal of each of these<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H}\)</span> atoms forms a different alkyl group with a different name, propyl or isopropyl.</p>
<p>An <strong>alkyl group</strong> is derived from an alkane (a hydrocarbon with only single bonds) by removing one hydrogen atom. This allows the group to bond to another molecule (such as another carbon chain). When you remove a hydrogen atom from different positions on a molecule, you can create different alkyl groups.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>

<h4 id="explanation-using-propane">Explanation using propane</h4>
<p>In this example, the molecule in focus is <strong>propane</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C3H8}\)</span>), which has 3 carbon atoms. Propane can form two different alkyl groups depending on where you remove a hydrogen atom:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>1° (Primary) Hydrogen</strong>: A primary hydrogen is attached to a <strong>primary carbon</strong>—a carbon that is connected to only <strong>one other carbon</strong>. In propane, the hydrogens on the <strong>end carbons</strong> are primary hydrogens. If you remove one of these, you get a <strong>propyl</strong> group (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{-CH2CH2CH3}\)</span>).</li>
<li><strong>Propyl group</strong>: The name "propyl" refers to an alkyl group derived from propane by removing a hydrogen atom from one of the end carbon atoms. This gives you a linear chain that can attach to another molecule.</li>
<li><strong>2° (Secondary) Hydrogen</strong>: A secondary hydrogen is attached to a <strong>secondary carbon</strong>—a carbon that is connected to <strong>two other carbons</strong>. In propane, the middle carbon is a secondary carbon. Removing a hydrogen from this middle carbon gives you an <strong>isopropyl</strong> group (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{-(CH3)CHCH3}\)</span>).</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Isopropyl group</strong>: This is a branched alkyl group where the middle carbon atom is attached to two methyl groups (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3}\)</span>). It is derived by removing a hydrogen from the central carbon of propane, creating a Y-shaped branch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Propyl</strong> is created by removing a hydrogen from a <strong>primary carbon</strong> (end carbon) of propane.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Isopropyl</strong> is created by removing a hydrogen from a <strong>secondary carbon</strong> (middle carbon) of propane.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h4>
<p>Different alkyl groups can have different chemical properties and reactivity, even though they come from the same base molecule (propane in this case). This difference in structure is important in organic chemistry when naming compounds or predicting how molecules will react.</p>
<p>Would you like to go into more details about primary and secondary carbons, or how these groups affect reactivity?</p>
<h3 id="naming-four-different-alkyl-groups">Naming four different alkyl groups</h3>
<p>There are two different butane isomers which yield four possible alkyl groups containing four carbons.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/types-of-butyl.png" width=400 />
</p>

<p>The prefixes like <strong>"iso-"</strong>, <strong>"sec-"</strong>, and <strong>"tert-"</strong> are used in the <strong>naming of alkyl groups</strong> to describe their <strong>branching</strong> patterns. These prefixes help specify how the alkyl group is attached and how the carbon atoms are arranged. Here's an explanation of each:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"n-" (normal or straight)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>: No branching.</p>
</li>
<li>Example: <strong>n-butyl</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2-}\)</span>)</li>
<li>
<p>This prefix is sometimes omitted when the alkyl group is a straight chain of carbon atoms, so <strong>butyl</strong> usually implies a straight chain unless otherwise specified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"iso-" (isomer)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>: The group has <strong>branching</strong>, specifically with a <strong>methyl group</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{-CH3}\)</span>) attached to the second carbon from the end of the chain.</p>
</li>
<li>Example: <strong>isobutyl</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{(CH3)2CHCH2-}\)</span>)</li>
<li>
<p>The "iso-" prefix indicates that the group has a branch at the second carbon, making the structure look like a "Y." For isobutyl, this branching occurs at the second carbon of a three-carbon chain, with two <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3}\)</span> groups attached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"sec-" (secondary)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>: The hydrogen atom is removed from a <strong>secondary carbon</strong> (a carbon atom bonded to two other carbons).</p>
</li>
<li>Example: <strong>sec-butyl</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3CH2CH(CH3)-}\)</span>)</li>
<li>
<p>In this structure, the branching happens because the hydrogen is removed from a <strong>secondary</strong> (2°) carbon, which is bonded to two other carbons. It indicates that the point of attachment is at the second carbon of the chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"tert-" (tertiary)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meaning</strong>: The hydrogen atom is removed from a <strong>tertiary carbon</strong> (a carbon atom bonded to <strong>three other carbons</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>Example: <strong>tert-butyl</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{(CH3)3C-}\)</span>)</li>
<li>
<p>In this case, the "tert-" prefix tells us that the attachment occurs at a <strong>tertiary</strong> (3°) carbon, which is connected to three other carbons. This results in a highly branched structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Butyl</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2-}\)</span>): No branching (a straight chain).</p>
</li>
<li><strong>sec-Butyl</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3CH2CH(CH3)-}\)</span>): The attachment happens at a <strong>secondary carbon</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Isobutyl</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{(CH3)2CHCH2-}\)</span>): A branching with a methyl group attached to the second carbon.</li>
<li><strong>tert-Butyl</strong> (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{(CH3)3C-}\)</span>): A highly branched structure with the attachment at a <strong>tertiary carbon</strong>.</li>

</ul>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/IUPAC-step1.png" width=500 />
</p>

<p>If there are two chains of equal length, pick the chain with more substituents. In the following example, two different chains in the same alkane have seven <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C}\)</span> atoms. The left one identifies our main chain, as it contains a higher number of substituents.</p>

</ul>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/numbering-chain.png" width=400 />

<p align="center">

</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Name and number the substituents.</li>
<li>Name the substituents as alkyl groups. Every carbon belongs to either the longest chain or a substituent, not both.</li>
<li>Each substituent needs its own number</li>
<li>If two or more identical substituents are bonded to the longest chain, use prefixes to indicate how many:<ul>
<li>"di-" for two groups</li>
<li>"tri-" for three groups</li>
<li>"tetra-" for four groups</li>
<li>and so forth.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Combine substituents names and number + parent + suffixo</li>
<li>Precede the name of the parent by the names of the substituents</li>

<h4 id="naming-alkanes-vs-cycloalkanes">Naming alkanes vs. cycloalkanes</h4>
<p>If the number of carbons in the ring is greater than or equal to the number of carbons in the longest chain, the compound is named as a cycloalkane. If there are more carbons in the chain, the compound is named as an alkane.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/who-has-it-bigger.png" width=600 />
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Sidenote</em></strong>
Whenever a cycloalkane has at least two substituents, one of them will always be assigned position 1, and here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Position 1 is always assigned to one of the substituents: The ring numbering always starts at one of the carbons that has a substituent. So, in cases with two or more substituents, the IUPAC rules ensure that one substituent is at position 1.</li>
<li>The numbering is done to minimize the numbers assigned to the rest of the substituents: After position 1 is assigned, the remaining substituents are numbered to follow the lowest locant rule. If there are multiple ways to number the ring, alphabetical order is used to decide which substituent gets position 1.</li>

<h2 id="conformation-of-acyclic-alkanes">Conformation of acyclic alkanes</h2>
<p>Conformations are different arrangements of atoms that are interconverted by rotation about single bonds</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/acyclic-alkanes-conformation.png" width=400 />
</p>

<p>Names are given to two different conformations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eclipsed conformation</strong>: The <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C—H}\)</span>bonds on one carbon are directly aligned with the<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C—H}\)</span> bonds on the adjacent carbon.</li>
<li><strong>Staggered conformation</strong>: The <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C—H}\)</span>bonds on one carbon bisect the<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H—C—H}\)</span> bond angle on the adjacent carbon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rotating the atoms on one carbon by 60 degrees converts an eclipsed conformation into a staggered conformation, and vice versa.<br />
The angle that separates a bond on one atom from a bond on an adjacent atom is called a <strong>dihedral angle</strong>.<br />
For ethane in the staggered conformation, the dihedral angle for the <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C—H}\)</span> bonds is 60 degrees; for eclipsed ethane, it is 0 degrees.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>staggered</strong> and <strong>eclipsed</strong> conformations of ethane interconvert at room temperature.</li>
<li>The <strong>staggered conformations</strong> are more stable (lower in energy) than the <strong>eclipsed conformations</strong>.<ul>
<li>In the staggered form the atoms attached to the carbons are positioned as far away from each other as possible, minimizing the repulsion between electrons in adjacent bonds. In contrast, the eclipsed conformation has increased electron-electron repulsion as the bonds are aligned, leading to higher energy and instability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Electron-electron repulsion</strong> between bonds in the eclipsed conformation increases its energy compared with the staggered conformation, where the bonding electrons are farther apart.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="torsional-energy-in-ethane">Torsional energy in ethane</h3>

<p>The barrier to rotation determines how easily or freely a molecule can rotate around a single bond. If the barrier is small, the molecule can rotate relatively easily, whereas a large barrier would restrict free rotation. The barrier to rotation is mainly caused by torsional strain (due to eclipsed conformations, where atoms or groups are aligned and experience repulsive interactions) and, in some cases, steric strain (when large substituents clash as the molecule rotates).</p>

<p>Since the lowest energy conformations has all bonds staggered and all larger groups in an anti conformation, alkanes are drawn using zigzag skeletal structures to reflect this.</p>

<h3 id="angle-strain-in-cycloalkanes">Angle strain in cycloalkanes</h3>
<p>Besides torsional and steric strain, the conformations of cycloalkanes are also affected by <strong>angle strain</strong> <span class="arithmatex">\(\rightarrow\)</span> an incrementail increase in energy when bond angle deviate from the optimal 109.5° angles found in tethrahedral structures. </p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Cycloalkanes with more than three <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C}\)</span> atoms in the ring are not flat molecules. They are puckered to reduce strain.</p>

<p>Cycloalkanes distort their shape in to alleviate angle and torsional strain</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/cycloalkanes-shape-distortion.png" width=500 />
</p>

<p>The image below illustrates that if cyclohexane were flat, it would experience <strong>angle strain</strong> due to the bond angles being 120°, larger than the ideal 109.5°. Additionally, all hydrogens would be aligned in an <strong>eclipsed conformation</strong>, causing <strong>torsional strain</strong>. </p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/cyclohexane-torsion-example.png" width=500 />
</p>

<p>A flat cyclohexane structure would suffer from <strong>angle strain</strong>, as the bond angles (120°) deviate from the ideal tetrahedral angle (109.5°), and <strong>torsional strain</strong>, due to eclipsed hydrogens. Cyclohexane adopts a chair conformation to minimize these strains, creating a more stable, lower-energy structure.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/cyclohexane-chairconfi.png" width=500 />
</p>

<p>The chair conformation is so stable because it eliminates angle strain (all <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C—C—C}\)</span>angles are 109.5 degrees), and torsional strain (all hydrogens on adjacent<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C}\)</span> atoms are staggered).</p>

<p><strong>Axial vs Equatorial</strong>
<img alt="" src="assets/axial-equatorial-h.png" />
1. <strong>Axial Hydrogens</strong>: These hydrogens point <strong>straight up or down</strong>, perpendicular to the plane of the ring. There are six axial hydrogens, one on each carbon atom. They alternate in direction—if one carbon has an axial hydrogen pointing up, the next carbon will have its axial hydrogen pointing down.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Equatorial Hydrogens</strong>: These hydrogens point <strong>outwards around the ring</strong>, roughly parallel to the plane of the ring. They are spread out more, reducing crowding (steric strain), and are positioned in a staggered way with respect to the axial hydrogens.</li>
</ol>
<p>In simple terms, <strong>axial hydrogens stick straight up or down</strong>, while <strong>equatorial hydrogens stick out sideways</strong> around the ring. This arrangement helps reduce strain in the cyclohexane molecule, making the chair conformation very stable.</p>

<h4 id="ring-flipping">Ring flipping</h4>
<p>Cyclohexanes undergo a conformational change called <strong>ring-flipping</strong></p>
<p>As a result of a ring flip, the up carbons become down carbons and the down carbons become up carbons. Axial and equatorial <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H}\)</span>atoms are also interconverted during a <strong>ring-flip</strong>; axial<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H}\)</span>atoms become equatorial<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H}\)</span>atoms and equatorial<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H}\)</span> atoms become axial.</p>

<p>There are two possible chair conformations, the equatorial position has more room than the axial position <span class="arithmatex">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> larger substituents are more stable in the equatorial positions.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/chair-conformations-boat.png" width=500 />
</p>

<ul>
<li>Cyclohexane also can exist in a boat conformation.</li>
<li>The boat forms of cyclohexane are <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{7 kcal/mol}\)</span> less stable than the chair forms.</li>
</ul>
<p>The boat conformation is destabilized by torsional strain because the hydrogens on the four carbon atoms in the plane are eclipsed. Additionally, there is steric strain because two hydrogens at either end of the boat, the "flag pole" hydrogens, are forced close to each other.</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/boat-conformation-eclipse.png" width=500 />
</p>

<p>While less stable, the boat conformation is not a fixed state. Cyclohexane molecules are constantly undergoing a conformational change called "ring-flipping," which interconverts between different conformations, including the boat conformation. However, due to its higher energy, the boat conformation is less populated compared to the chair conformations at equilibrium.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the context of conformational analysis, "population" refers to the relative abundance of different conformations of a molecule at equilibrium. Molecules in a solution constantly interconvert between different conformations due to bond rotation. The distribution of molecules among these different conformations is determined by their relative energies <span class="arithmatex">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> at equilibrium, a greater proportion of cyclohexane molecules will exist in the chair conformation, making it more populated than the boat conformation.</p>

<li>Draw axial and equatorial bonds. On a down <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{C}\)</span> the axial bond is down.</li>
<li>Ring flipping converts axial bonds to equatorial bonds. The equatorial <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3}\)</span> becomes axial.</li>

</ul>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/ring-flipping-axial-swap-eq.png" width=700 />
</p>

<p>The two chair conformations of cyclohexane are different, so they are not equally stable. Larger axial substituents create destabilizing <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{1,3-diaxial interactions}\)</span>. In methylcyclohexane, each unfavorable <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{H}\)</span>,<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3}\)</span>interaction destabilizes the conformation by<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{0.9 kcal/mol}\)</span>, so Conformation <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{B}\)</span> <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{is 1.8 kcal/mol}\)</span>less stable than Conformation<span class="arithmatex">\(\text{A}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In simple terms, methylcyclohexane is a molecule that can exist in different shapes (called conformations). These shapes can change when the ring structure (cyclohexane) flips. In one of these shapes, Conformation A, the bulky methyl group (<span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3}\)</span>) is in a position where it doesn't clash much with the nearby hydrogen atoms. This makes Conformation A more stable.</p>
<p>However, when the ring flips to Conformation B, the methyl group is in a position where it interacts closely with the hydrogen atoms. These interactions are unfavorable because the atoms are too close to each other, causing strain. Each of these interactions adds 0.9 kcal/mol of energy, which makes the molecule less stable.</p>
<p>Since there are two such interactions in Conformation B, the total increase in energy is <span class="arithmatex">\(2 \times 0.9 = \text{1.8 kcal/mol}\)</span>. This means Conformation B is <span class="arithmatex">\(\text{1.8 kcal/mol}\)</span> less stable than Conformation A because of these clashes between the hydrogen atoms and the methyl group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 <strong>What is meant by diaxial?</strong>
<em>Diaxial interactions happen when a group in the axial position of cyclohexane interacts with axial hydrogens on the same side of the ring.</em>
When a bulky group, such as a methyl group <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{CH3}\)</span>, is placed in an axial position on the cyclohexane ring, it can come into close contact with the axial hydrogens on the same side of the ring. These are called diaxial interactions because they involve two axial substituents (the methyl group and the hydrogen atoms).</p>

</p>

<p>The larger the substituent on the six-membered ring the higher the percentage of equatorial conformation at equilibrium:
- With a very large substituent like tert-butyl <span class="arithmatex">\(\ce{(CH3)3C-}\)</span> essentially none of the of the conformation containing an axial tert-butyl group is present at room temperature</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/tert-butyl-axial-vs-equatorial.png" width=600 />
</p>

<p>This example illustrates a fundamental concept in cyclohexane chair conformations: steric hindrance and the influence of large substituents on the stability of axial versus equatorial positions.</p>
<p><strong>Steric Hindrance in the Axial Position</strong>:
   - The tert-butyl group <span class="arithmatex">\((CH_3)_3C^−\)</span> is very large and bulky. When positioned in the <strong>axial</strong> position (structure C), this group experiences significant steric crowding from the other axial hydrogens on carbons 3 and 5, known as <strong>1,3-diaxial interactions</strong>. These interactions create a highly destabilized environment for the tert-butyl group in the axial position, as depicted by the "very crowded" labeling and highlighted hydrogens in structure C.</p>
<p><strong>Stabilization in the Equatorial Position</strong>:
   - In the <strong>equatorial</strong> position (structure D), the bulky tert-butyl group points outward, away from the other groups on the ring, significantly reducing steric interactions with nearby atoms. This position minimizes steric hindrance, making the equatorial conformation far more stable for such a large group.</p>
<h4 id="disubstituted-cycloalkanes">Disubstituted cycloalkanes</h4>
<p>There are two different <strong>1,2-dimethylcyclopentanes</strong>:
