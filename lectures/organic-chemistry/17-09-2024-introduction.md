## What is Organic Chemistry?

- Organic chemistry is the study of chemistry compounds that contain the element carbon, many of which are found in living organisms.

- It is one branch in the entire field chemistry, which encompasses many subdisciplines.
- There are far more organic compounds than any other type.
  - Medicines
  - Food
  - Clothing
  - Gasoline
  - Soaps
  - Refrigerants

### Features of organic compounds

- All organic compounds contain carbon atoms **C** and most hydrogen atoms **H**.
- All the carbon atoms have 4 bonds, a stable carbon atom is said to be tetravalent.
- Any other atom that is not a carbon or a hydrogen is called "heteroatom".
  - Common heteroatoms includes **N**, **O**, **S**, **P** and the **halogens**.
- Some compunds have chains of atoms while other have rings
