## Course Details
- **Credits**: 6 CFU
- **Course Goals**:
  - Summarize and visualize data.
  - Understand tools and models for analyzing random phenomena.
  - Learn fundamental methods of statistical inference.
  - Apply statistical methods to real data using appropriate software.

## Timetable
- **Monday**: 10:30 - 13:15 (Room T.0.3)
- **Wednesday**: 11:30 - 13:15 (Room 25.1.3)  
- **Additional Tutoring**: Tuesday 15:15 - 17:15 (Room T.0.3)

## Software

  - [An introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf)

## Course Program
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Data types, frequency distributions, summary statistics (mean, median, variance), visualizations (histograms, boxplots).
- **Probability and Random Variables**: Properties of probability, discrete and continuous distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Gaussian).
- **Estimation and Hypothesis Testing**: Confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, t-tests.
- **Comparing Samples**: Comparing means of independent and dependent samples.
- **Regression Models**: Linear models, parameter estimation, model evaluation, and residual analysis.

## Exam and Assessment
- **Written Exam**: Consists of two exercises in 2 hours. Graded on a scale of 0 to 30, with a passing score of 18.
- **Team Project**: Involving real data analysis in teams of 2-4 students. The project will be evaluated during a final seminar.

## Exam details
> Here a mere copy/paste of the exams details:

### Grading weights
- 70% written exam
- 30% project

### Written Exam
- **Format**: It will consist of 2 exercises to be solved autonomously in a maximum of 2 hours.
- **Evaluation**: 
  - The student will decide whether to have their exam evaluated at the end.
  - Scoring is from 0 to 30, with a maximum evaluation of 32/30.
  - The exam is passed with a score ≥ 18/30.
  - Evaluation considers clarity of exposition and correctness of computations.
- **Materials Allowed**: 
  - Calculator, statistical tables, and a formulary of A4 format containing any material deemed useful by the student.
- **Prohibited Items**: Books, notes, mobile phones, and other electronic devices.

### Team Project
- **Objective**: Analyze a real dataset in teams of 2 to 4 students, using the models and methods introduced in the course.
- **Presentation**: Projects will be presented at the end of the course in a seminar during an open workshop after the semester.
- **Evaluation**: Each team will receive a score from 0 to 30.
- **Final Evaluation**: The final course evaluation will be a weighted average of the scores, with weights of 0.7 for the written exam and 0.3 for the team project.

## Data Analysis Project Overview
Every student must participate in a data analysis project developed by an independently formed team of 2-4 members.

### Dataset Selection
- Groups will autonomously choose the dataset to analyze.
- Approval of the dataset by a course teacher is required before starting the analysis.
- Deadline for approved dataset: **October 14th**.

### Group Composition
Each group must communicate its composition, leader, and project title to the Project Manager:
- **Francesco Brossa**: francesco.brossa@mail.polimi.it

### Suggested Timeline
- **Selection of Dataset**: Before October 14th
- **Explorative Analyses**: Before November 15th
- **Inferential Analyses**: Before December 30th
- **Project Review and Final Presentation**: January
  - **First Work in Progress**: November 13
  - **Final Presentation Date**: January ?

## Project Steps
1. **Identify Stakeholders**: Company manager, competitors, students, etc.
2. **Identify Research Questions**: What problem do you want to solve based on the data?
3. **Build Dataset**: Select data, create labels, etc.
4. **Data Analysis**: Conduct explorative analysis, null hypothesis testing, regression.
5. **Report Findings**: Present answers to research questions using natural language, tables, and plots.
