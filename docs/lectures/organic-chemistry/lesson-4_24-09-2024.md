## Functional groups, intermolecular forces and physical properties

### Functional groups

- A functional group is an **atom** or a **group of atoms** with characteristic chemical and physical properties.

- Most organic molecules contain a carbon backbone, consisting of $\ce{C-C}$ and $\ce{C-H}$ bonds to which functional groups are attached.

- Structural features of a functional group:
    - **Heteroatoms** $\rightarrow$ atoms other than $\ce{C}$ or $\ce{H}$
    - Bonds commonly occur in $\ce{C-C}$ and $\ce{C-O}$ double bonds

Functional groups distinguish one organic molecule from another, they're able to determine a molecule's:
- Name
- Geometry
- Chemical and physical properties
- Reactivity

- They also pretty much create what are called as ***Classes of Organic Compounds*** $\rightarrow$ alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, alcohols and more...

#### Reactivity of functional groups

Heteratoms and bonds are responsible for the reactivity on a particular molecule
- Heteroatoms have lone pairs and create electron-deficient sites on carbon
- A bond makes a molecule base and a nuclephile, it is easily broken in chemical reactions


<p align="center">

</p>

- Lone pairs make $\ce{O}$ a base and a nucleophile
- The $\ce{C}$ atom is electron deficient, making it an electrophile
    - Heteroatoms often pull electron density away from nearby carbons because they are more electronegative.
    - This creates electron-deficient sites (partial positive charge, $\delta^+$) on those carbons, making them electrophilic (prone to be attacked by nucleophiles).

</p>

- The $\pi$ bond is easily broken.
- The $\pi$ bond makes a compound a base and a nucleophile.
    - In many chemical reactions, especially in **nucleophilic substitution** or **addition reactions**, the $\pi$ bond donates its electrons to form new bonds. Since the $\pi$ bond is more loosely held, it can be broken, allowing the electrons to be used in new bond formation with other atoms or groups.

#### Why $\pi$ bonds break so easily

**Electron-rich bonds**, such as **π bonds** in **double** or **triple bonds**, are more easily broken in chemical reactions because of their **weaker nature** and **exposed electron density**.

**Weaker Bond Energy**
   - **$\pi$ bonds** are generally weaker than **$\sigma$ bonds**.
     - **$\sigma$ bonds** are formed by **head-on overlap** of orbitals, which leads to a strong bond with electrons tightly held between the nuclei.
     - **$\pi$ bonds**, on the other hand, result from the **side-by-side overlap** of **p orbitals**. The overlap is less effective compared to the head-on overlap in σ bonds, making π bonds **weaker** and **easier to break**.

**Exposed Electron Density**
   - In a **$\pi$ bond**, the electrons are located **above and below** the plane of the atoms involved in the bond (in contrast to the **$\sigma$ bond**, where the electron density is directly between the nuclei).
   - This makes the **$\pi$ electrons more exposed** and less tightly held, making them more available for reaction.

### Parts of a functional group

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/parts-of-a-functional-group.png" />
</p>

- **Ethane**
    - Has all $\ce{C-C}$ and $\ce{C-H}$ $\sigma$ bonds
    - Has no functional group

- **Ethanol**
    - Polar $\ce{C-O}$ and $\ce{O-H}$ bonds
    - Two lone pairs

# Ethane, a Molecule with No Functional Group

- This molecule has only C—C and C—H bonds.
- It contains no polar bonds, lone pairs, or bonds.
- Therefore, ethane has no reactive sites (functional groups).
- Consequently, ethane and other alkanes are very unreactive.

# Ethanol

- Compounds containing an $\ce{HO}$ group are called **alcohols**.
- The hydroxy group makes the properties of ethanol very different from the properties of ethane.
- Ethanol has lone pairs and polar bonds that make it reactive.
- Other molecules with hydroxy groups will have similar properties to ethanol.

**NOTE**: The term **"backbone"** is used to describe the continuous chain of atoms that provides the main structure, to which other atoms or groups can be attached, influencing the molecule’s properties.

Ethane consists of **nonpolar $\ce{C-C}$ and weakly polar $\ce{C-H}$ bonds**, resulting in no significant reactive sites. It lacks functional groups and lone pairs, making it **chemically inert** under normal conditions and requiring high energy (e.g., combustion) to break its bonds. On the other hand, Ethanol has a **hydroxyl group ($\ce{-OH}$)**, making it much more reactive than ethane. The **polar $\ce{O-H}$ and $\ce{C-O}$ bonds** create partial charges, making the molecule susceptible to **nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks**. The hydroxyl group also enables ethanol to undergo various reactions (e.g., **oxidation**, **dehydration**, **esterification**) and form **hydrogen bonds**, increasing its overall reactivity.

### Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons are compounds make up of only the elements carbon and hydrogen; they may be aliphatic or aromatic

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/alkane-alkene-alkyne-aromatic-compunds.png" />
</p>

- Aliphatic hydrocarbons have three subgroups 
    - Alkanes have only $\ce{C-C}$ bonds and no functional group $\rightarrow \ce{C-C}$
    - Alkenes have a $\ce{C-C}$ double bond $\rightarrow \ce{C=C}$
    - Alkynes have a $\ce{C-C}$ triple bond $\rightarrow \ce{C#C}$ 

### Aromatic hydrocarbons

- Aromatic hydrocarbons are so named because many of the earliest known aromatic compounds had strong, characterstic odors.
- The simplest aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene.
- The six-membered ring and three bonds of benzene comprise a single functional group, found in most aromatic compounds.
    - The **phenyl group**

### Functional groups with carbon heteroatom $\ce{C-Z}$ $\sigma$ bonds

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/c-z-sigma-bond.png" width=400/>
</p>

The structure on the right shows a 3D molecular model where carbon is bonded to the heteroatom $\ce{Z}$ with an arrow indicating the direction of the electron density being pulled toward the more electronegative atom $\ce{Z}$.
- This type of bond is common in many functional groups like alcohols C—O, amines C—N, and halides C—Cl, C—Br, etc.

> **What's a halogen? a halide?**
> **Halogens** are highly reactive elements from Group 17 of the periodic table, including fluorine $\ce{F}$, chlorine $\ce{Cl}$, bromine $\ce{Br}$, and iodine $\ce{I}$. When a halogen forms a bond with another element, particularly carbon, the resulting compound is called a **halide**. Halides (e.g., alkyl halides) have polar carbon-halogen bonds due to the high electronegativity of halogens, making them reactive in organic chemical reactions like substitution and elimination.

</p>

### Functional groups with $\ce{C-O}$ group 

- This group is called a "carbonyl group"
- The polar $\ce{C=O}$ bond makes the carbonyl carbon an electrophile, while the lone pairs on $\ce{O}$ allow it to react as a nucleophile and base

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/carbonyl-group.png" width="300"/>
</p>
 
**NOTE**: the carbonyl group also contains a bond that is more easily broken than a $\ce{C-O}$ bond

#### Why all this fuss?

*SIGH... Notations!*

Carbon atoms are classified by the number of other carbon atoms they are bonded to: primary (1°) carbons are connected to one other carbon, secondary (2°) to two, tertiary (3°) to three, and quaternary (4°) to four. This helps in understanding molecular structure and reactivity. Similarly, hydrogen atoms are classified based on the type of carbon they are attached to. Functional groups like alcohols and alkyl halides are also categorized by the carbon they are bonded to, influencing their chemical behavior. Amines and amides are classified by the number of carbon atoms attached to the nitrogen, with primary (1°), secondary (2°), and tertiary (3°) amines or amides having one, two, or three carbon-nitrogen bonds, respectively. These classifications are key to predicting structure and reactivity in organic compounds.

This type of classification is pretty much just precise notation allows that chemists to describe molecules better, predict their reactivity, and understand how different structural features influence their chemical behavior.

### Why functional groups matter

A functional group in an organic compound plays a crucial role in determining its chemical and physical behavior. These characteristics can be outlined as follows:

- **Bonding and Shape**: The functional group influences the type of bonding (such as single, double, or triple bonds) and the molecular geometry, which affects how molecules interact with one another and fit into reaction mechanisms.
  
- **Type and Strength of Intermolecular Forces**: The functional group dictates the type of intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, or dipole-dipole interactions. These forces influence properties like boiling and melting points.

- **Chemical and Physical Properties**: The presence of a functional group affects properties such as solubility, acidity or basicity, and volatility, directly shaping the compound's behavior in different environments.

- **Nomenclature**: Functional groups also determine the naming of organic compounds, as they are often used as the basis for the systematic naming (IUPAC) of molecules.

- **Chemical Reactivity**: Functional groups govern how molecules react with other substances, dictating the types of reactions they undergo, their reaction mechanisms, and their overall reactivity in organic synthesis.

These aspects help chemists predict how molecules behave and interact based on their functional groups.

### What are intermolecular forces?

Intermolecular forces are interactions that exist between molecules, functional groups determine the type and strength of these interactions. For a figurative sense, ionic and covalent compounds have very different intermolecular interactions:

#### Ion-Ion interactions

In an ionic compound, such as sodium chloride $\ce{NaCl}$, the positively charged sodium ions $\ce{Na}^+$ and negatively charged chloride ions $\ce{Cl}^-$ are arranged in a repeating lattice structure. The ions are held together by the **electrostatic forces** of attraction between opposite charges.

**Sidenote**: This strong interaction is responsible for the high melting and boiling points of ionic compounds because a significant amount of energy is required to break these strong bonds.

> Ion-ion interactions are among the strongest types of attractive forces in chemistry because they involve full charges and lead to the stable, rigid structures seen in many ionic solids. This is what gives ionic compounds distinct physical properties, like hardness and high thermal stability.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/electrostatic-na-cl.png" width=300 />
</p>

This image describes **ion-ion interactions**, which are the strong electrostatic attractions that occur between oppositely charged ions in ionic compounds. These interactions are a type of **intermolecular force** but are much stronger than the forces found between covalent molecules.

The image also highlights that **ion-ion interactions** are much stronger than the **intermolecular forces** present in covalent molecules, such as **van der Waals forces** or **hydrogen bonding**.
- In covalent compounds, the molecules themselves are neutral or only slightly polar, so the interactions between them are weaker compared to the full charges found in ionic compounds.

### Intermolecular forces in covalent molecules

Covalent compunds are composed of discrete molecules, the natures of the forces between molecules dependes on the functional group(s) present. There are generally four types of interactions, we'll list them in order of increasing strength:
- **van der Waals** or dispersive forces
- **dipole-dipole** interactions
- hydrogen bonding
- ionic interactions

#### van der Waals forces

Van der Waals forces, also known as **London dispersion forces**, are the weakest type of intermolecular forces. These forces arise due to **temporary fluctuations in electron density** within a molecule, which create **instantaneous dipoles**. Even in nonpolar molecules where there is no permanent dipole, the random movement of electrons can momentarily cause a slight imbalance in charge distribution. This temporary dipole can induce a corresponding dipole in a neighboring molecule, leading to an **induced dipole-induced dipole interaction**.

While van der Waals forces are weak, **they are significant in large numbers**. These forces are especially important in nonpolar compounds, where no permanent dipoles exist to generate stronger interactions like hydrogen bonds or dipole-dipole forces.

The strength of van der Waals forces increases with the size and surface area of the molecule because larger molecules have more electrons and a greater ability to become polarized.

**NOTE**: This is why larger nonpolar molecules like iodine $\ce{I_2}$ or long-chain hydrocarbons have higher boiling and melting points compared to smaller nonpolar molecules like helium $\ce{He}$ or methane ($\ce{CH_4}$).

#### var der Waals forces in methane

- $\ce{CH_4}$ has no net dipole
- At any one instant, its electron density may not be completely symmetrical, resulting in a temporary dipole.
- This can induce a temporary dipole in another molecule.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/van-der-waals-temp-dipole.png" />
</p>

#### var der Waals forces in relation with surface area

All compunds exhibit van der Waals forces $\rightarrow$ The larger the surface area of a molcules, the larger the attractive forces between two molecules, and the stronger the intermolecular forces.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/van-der-waals-forces-and-area.png" />
</p>

#### var der Waals forces and polarizability

**Polarizability** refers to how easily the electron cloud around an atom can be distorted by external forces. **Larger atoms, with more loosely held valence electrons**, are more polarizable than smaller atoms. This means that compounds with larger, more polarizable atoms experience stronger van der Waals forces compared to compounds with smaller, less polarizable atoms.

- Polarizability increases in larger atoms because their valence electrons are farther from the nucleus, meaning they experience a weaker attraction to the positively charged nucleus.
- This weaker attraction allows the electron cloud to be **more easily distorted or shifted when subjected to external forces**, such as the presence of a nearby dipole or temporary charge fluctuation $\rightarrow$ it is more malleable.

Instead in smaller atoms, the valence electrons are closer to the nucleus and more tightly held, making them less susceptible to such distortions.

### Dipole-Dipole interactions

Dipole-Dipole interactions are the attractive forces between the permanent dipoles of two polar molecules. The dipoles in adjacent molecules align so that the partial positive and partial negative charges are in close proximity.

**NOTE**: These attractive forces caused by permanent dipoles are much stronger than weak van der Waals forces

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/acetone-dipole-dipole.png" />
</p>

#### Intermolecular non-covalent bonding forces

Dipole-dipole interactions can occur when both the drug and the binding site have permanent dipole moments. As the drug approaches the binding site, the dipoles of the drug and the binding site align with each other. This alignment helps the drug orient itself correctly within the binding site. 

This orientation is **beneficial** if it allows other functional groups on the drug to interact with the corresponding regions of the binding site effectively, enhancing the binding strength.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/dipole-binding-site.png" />
</p>

However, if the dipoles align but the other binding groups on the drug are **not positioned correctly**, this orientation can be **detrimental**, reducing the effectiveness of the interaction.

The strength of dipole-dipole interactions decreases with distance between the drug and the binding site, but it diminishes less quickly than weaker forces like van der Waals interactions. However, it still fades faster than stronger electrostatic (ionic) interactions.

> **What really is a drug this context?**
> In this context, the "drug" refers to a small molecule that is designed or naturally occurs to bind to a specific target site in the body, often a protein (such as an enzyme or receptor). The drug’s goal is to interact with this target site to produce a therapeutic effect, such as inhibiting an enzyme, activating a receptor, or blocking a signaling pathway

#### Hydrogen bonding

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/hydrogen-bonding.png" />
</p>

Hydrogen bonding typically occurs when a hydrogen atom bonded to O, N, or F, is electrostatically attracted to a lone pair of electrons on an O, N, or F atom in another molecule.
