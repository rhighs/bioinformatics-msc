## Tetrahedral geometry of Carbon

All C atoms in an alkane are surrounded by four groups, making them $\ce{sp^3}$ hybridized and tetrahedral, with all bond angles of $\text{109.5°}$. The 3D representation and ball-stick models for these alkanes indicate the tetrahedral geometry around each $\ce{C}$ atom.

In contrast, the Lewis structures are not meant to imply any 3D arrangement.

## Drawing compounds

The three-carbon alkane $\ce{CH3CH2CH3}$ aka propane has a moleculer formula $\ce{C3H8}$. In the 3D representation, each $\ce{C}$ atom has two bonds in the plane, one in bond front and one bond behind.

</p>

The five-carbon alkane $\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3}$ called pentane, has mol formula $\ce{C5H12}$.

The carbon skeleton for pentane can be drawn in a variety of ways really, each of the following representations has five carbons in a row and represents pentane (not an isomer of pentane).

</p>

## Constitutional isomers

There are two different ways to arrange four carbons, giving two compounds with molecular formula $\ce{C4H10}$, named butane and isobutane. Butane and isobutane are constitutional isomers—two different compounds with the same molecular formula. Constitutional isomers (also called structural isomers) differ in the way the atoms are connected to each other

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/butane-isobutane.png" width=500 />
</p>

Butane is an example of a straight-chain alkane, while isobutane is a branched-chain alkane. This difference in structure influences their boiling points, melting points, and how they interact in chemical reactions.

**General formula**: $\ce{C_nH_{2n+2}}$

## Cycloalkanes

Cycloalkanes have a molecular formula of $\rightarrow$ $\ce{C_nH_2_n}$ and contain carbon atoms arranged in a ring. Simple cycloalkanes are named by adding the prefix *cyclo-* to the name of the acyclic alkane having the same number of carbons.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/cyclo-alkanes-examples.png" width=500 />
</p>

**NOTE**: these all have two fewer $\ce{H}$ atoms than an acyclic alkane with the same number of carbons

## Understanding nomenclature

The name of every organic molecule has 3 parts:

1. The **parent** name indicates the number of carbons in the longest continuous chain.
2. The **suffix** indicates what functional group is present.
3. The **prefix** tells us the identity, location, and number of substituents attached to the carbon chain.

\[
\text{prefix} + \text{parent} + \text{suffix}
\]

- **Prefix:** What and where are the substituents?
- **Parent:** What is the longest carbon chain?
- **Suffix:** What is the functional group?

**NOTE**: substituents are atoms or groups of atoms that replace one or more hydrogen atoms attached to the main carbon chain (or parent structure) of a molecule. They modify the basic structure of the molecule and can significantly influence its chemical properties, reactivity, and naming.

### Naming substituents -Alkyl groups

Carbon substituents bonded to a long carbon chain are called **alkyl groups**. An alkyl group is formed by removing one H atom from an alkane.

- To name an alkyl group, change the *-ane* ending of the parent alkane to *-yl*
    - Methane $\ce{CH4} $$\rightarrow$ Methyl $\ce{CH3}-$
    - Ethane $\ce{CH3CH3} $$\rightarrow$ Ethyl $\ce{CH3CH2}-$

### Naming three alkyl groups

Naming three or four alkyl groups is more complicated because the parent *hydrocarbons* have more than one type of hydrogen atom. For example, consider propane: it has both 1 degree and 2 degrees $\ce{H}$ atoms and removal of each of these $\ce{H}$ atoms forms a different alkyl group with a different name, propyl or isopropyl.

An **alkyl group** is derived from an alkane (a hydrocarbon with only single bonds) by removing one hydrogen atom. This allows the group to bond to another molecule (such as another carbon chain). When you remove a hydrogen atom from different positions on a molecule, you can create different alkyl groups.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/propyl-isopropyl-substituents-names.png" width=500 />
</p>

#### Explanation using propane
In this example, the molecule in focus is **propane** ($\ce{C3H8}$), which has 3 carbon atoms. Propane can form two different alkyl groups depending on where you remove a hydrogen atom:

1. **1° (Primary) Hydrogen**: A primary hydrogen is attached to a **primary carbon**—a carbon that is connected to only **one other carbon**. In propane, the hydrogens on the **end carbons** are primary hydrogens. If you remove one of these, you get a **propyl** group ($\ce{-CH2CH2CH3}$).
   - **Propyl group**: The name "propyl" refers to an alkyl group derived from propane by removing a hydrogen atom from one of the end carbon atoms. This gives you a linear chain that can attach to another molecule.
   
2. **2° (Secondary) Hydrogen**: A secondary hydrogen is attached to a **secondary carbon**—a carbon that is connected to **two other carbons**. In propane, the middle carbon is a secondary carbon. Removing a hydrogen from this middle carbon gives you an **isopropyl** group ($\ce{-(CH3)CHCH3}$).
   - **Isopropyl group**: This is a branched alkyl group where the middle carbon atom is attached to two methyl groups ($\ce{CH3}$). It is derived by removing a hydrogen from the central carbon of propane, creating a Y-shaped branch.

- **Propyl** is created by removing a hydrogen from a **primary carbon** (end carbon) of propane.
- **Isopropyl** is created by removing a hydrogen from a **secondary carbon** (middle carbon) of propane.

#### Why this matters
Different alkyl groups can have different chemical properties and reactivity, even though they come from the same base molecule (propane in this case). This difference in structure is important in organic chemistry when naming compounds or predicting how molecules will react.

Would you like to go into more details about primary and secondary carbons, or how these groups affect reactivity?

### Naming four different alkyl groups

There are two different butane isomers which yield four possible alkyl groups containing four carbons.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/types-of-butyl.png" width=400 />
</p>


The prefixes like **"iso-"**, **"sec-"**, and **"tert-"** are used in the **naming of alkyl groups** to describe their **branching** patterns. These prefixes help specify how the alkyl group is attached and how the carbon atoms are arranged. Here's an explanation of each:

- **"n-" (normal or straight)**
    - **Meaning**: No branching.
    - Example: **n-butyl** ($\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2-}$)
    - This prefix is sometimes omitted when the alkyl group is a straight chain of carbon atoms, so **butyl** usually implies a straight chain unless otherwise specified.

- **"iso-" (isomer)**
    - **Meaning**: The group has **branching**, specifically with a **methyl group** ($\ce{-CH3}$) attached to the second carbon from the end of the chain.
    - Example: **isobutyl** ($\ce{(CH3)2CHCH2-}$)
  - The "iso-" prefix indicates that the group has a branch at the second carbon, making the structure look like a "Y." For isobutyl, this branching occurs at the second carbon of a three-carbon chain, with two $\ce{CH3}$ groups attached.

- **"sec-" (secondary)**
    - **Meaning**: The hydrogen atom is removed from a **secondary carbon** (a carbon atom bonded to two other carbons).
    - Example: **sec-butyl** ($\ce{CH3CH2CH(CH3)-}$)
    - In this structure, the branching happens because the hydrogen is removed from a **secondary** (2°) carbon, which is bonded to two other carbons. It indicates that the point of attachment is at the second carbon of the chain.

- **"tert-" (tertiary)**
    - **Meaning**: The hydrogen atom is removed from a **tertiary carbon** (a carbon atom bonded to **three other carbons**).
    - Example: **tert-butyl** ($\ce{(CH3)3C-}$)
  - In this case, the "tert-" prefix tells us that the attachment occurs at a **tertiary** (3°) carbon, which is connected to three other carbons. This results in a highly branched structure.

- **Butyl** ($\ce{CH3CH2CH2CH2-}$): No branching (a straight chain).
    - **sec-Butyl** ($\ce{CH3CH2CH(CH3)-}$): The attachment happens at a **secondary carbon**.
    - **Isobutyl** ($\ce{(CH3)2CHCH2-}$): A branching with a methyl group attached to the second carbon.
    - **tert-Butyl** ($\ce{(CH3)3C-}$): A highly branched structure with the attachment at a **tertiary carbon**.

### How to name an alkane using the IUPAC System

- **Step 1**: find the parent carbon chain and add the suffix

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/IUPAC-step1.png" width=500 />
</p>

If there are two chains of equal length, pick the chain with more substituents. In the following example, two different chains in the same alkane have seven $\ce{C}$ atoms. The left one identifies our main chain, as it contains a higher number of substituents.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/chain-with-more-substituents.png" width=400 />
</p>

- **Step 2**: Numbering the atoms in the carbon chain to give the first substituent the lowest number.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/numbering-chain.png" width=400 />
</p>

If the first substituent is the same distance from both ends, number the chain to give the second substituent the lower number

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/numbering-chain-2.png" width=500 />
</p>

When numbering a carbon chain results in the same numbers from either end of the chain, assign the lower number alphabetically to the first substituent

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/numbering-chain-alpha.png" width=500 />
</p>

- **Step 3**: Name and number the substituents.
    - Name the substituents as alkyl groups. Every carbon belongs to either the longest chain or a substituent, not both.
    - Each substituent needs its own number
    - If two or more identical substituents are bonded to the longest chain, use prefixes to indicate how many:
        - "di-" for two groups
        - "tri-" for three groups
        - "tetra-" for four groups
        - and so forth.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/name-and-number-substituents.png" width=300 />
</p>

- **Step 4**: Combine substituents names and number + parent + suffixo
    - Precede the name of the parent by the names of the substituents
    - Alphabetize the names of the substituents, ignoring all prefixes except iso, as in isopropyl and isobutyl
    - Precede the name of each substituent by the number that indicates its location

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/5-ethyl-2-6-dimethyloctane.png" width=600 />
</p>

**NOTE**: Separate numbers by commas and separate numbers from letters by hyphens. The name of an alkane is a single word, with no spaces after hyphens and commas.

#### Wrapping up the steps

Intepreting IUPAC naming via pseudocode
```
function generateIUPACName(molecule) {
    // Step 1: Find the longest continuous carbon chain in the molecule
    parentChain = findLongestChain(molecule)

    // If there are multiple chains with the same length, pick the one that has the most substituents attached
    if (multipleChainsWithSameLength(molecule)) {
        parentChain = chooseChainWithMostSubstituents(chains)
    }

    // Step 2: Number the carbons in the parent chain starting from the end that gives the first substituent the lowest possible number
    numberedChain = numberChain(parentChain)

    // Step 3: Identify all substituents attached to the chain and note their positions
    substituents = findSubstituents(numberedChain)

    // Ensure the numbering gives the first substituent the smallest number
    numberedChain = minimizeFirstSubstituentNumber(numberedChain, substituents)

    // If the first substituent is equally far from both ends, adjust numbering to give the second substituent the lower number
    numberedChain = handleEqualPositionForFirstSubstituent(numberedChain, substituents)

    // Step 4: Name and number the substituents
    for each substituent in substituents {
        // Get the alkyl name for the substituent (e.g., methyl, ethyl)
        name = getAlkylName(substituent)

        // If there are multiple identical substituents, add the correct prefix (di-, tri-)
        count = countIdenticalSubstituents(substituents, substituent)
        prefix = count > 1 ? getPrefixForCount(count) : ""

        // Combine the position number, prefix, and name for the substituent
        substituentNames.push(substituent.position + "-" + prefix + name)
    }

    // Step 5: Sort the substituent names alphabetically, ignoring di-, tri-, tetra-, except for iso-
    substituentNames.sortAlphabetically()

    // Step 6: Build the full IUPAC name by joining all the substituent names, followed by the parent chain name
    parentName = getParentChainName(parentChain.length)
    iupacName = combineNames(substituentNames, parentName)

    return iupacName
}
```

### How to name a cycloalkane using the IUAPAC

Cycloalkanes are named using similar rules, but the prefix cyclo immediately precedes the name of the parent.

$$
\text{1. \,\,prefix} + \textcolor{blue}{\text{2. \,\,cyclo-}} + \text{3. \,\,parent} + \text{4. \,\,suffix}
$$

**1. Prefix** $\rightarrow$ What and where are the substituents?
**3. Parent** $\rightarrow$ How many C's are in the ring?
**4. Suffix**: $\rightarrow$ What is the functional group?

- **Step 1**: find the parent cycloalkane

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/parent-cycloalkane.png" width=300 />
</p>

- **Step 2**: name and number the substituents. No number is needed to indicate the location of a single substituent. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/numbering-naming-subst-cycloalkanes.png" width=500 />
</p>

For rings with more than one substituent, begin numbering at one substituent and proceed around the ring to give the second substituent the lowest number

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/numebring-order-cycloalkane.png" width=500 />
</p>

**Then, just as in alkanes**: with two different substituents, number the ring to assign the lower number to the substituents alphabetically.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/iupac-cycloalkane-alpha.png" width=600 />
</p>

#### Naming alkanes vs. cycloalkanes

If the number of carbons in the ring is greater than or equal to the number of carbons in the longest chain, the compound is named as a cycloalkane. If there are more carbons in the chain, the compound is named as an alkane.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/who-has-it-bigger.png" width=600 />
</p>

> ***Sidenote***
> Whenever a cycloalkane has at least two substituents, one of them will always be assigned position 1, and here's why:
> - Position 1 is always assigned to one of the substituents: The ring numbering always starts at one of the carbons that has a substituent. So, in cases with two or more substituents, the IUPAC rules ensure that one substituent is at position 1.
> - The numbering is done to minimize the numbers assigned to the rest of the substituents: After position 1 is assigned, the remaining substituents are numbered to follow the lowest locant rule. If there are multiple ways to number the ring, alphabetical order is used to decide which substituent gets position 1.

### Common Names for some Polycyclic Alkanes

- Some organic compounds are identified using common names that do not follow the IUPAC system of nomenclature.
- Many of these names were given long ago before the IUPAC system was adopted, and are still widely used. Additionally, some names are descriptive of shape and structure, like those below

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/cycloalkanes-polyciclic-funny.png" width=600 />
</p>

#### Fossil Fuels

- Many alkanes occur in nature, primarily in natural gas and petroleum.
- **Natural gas** is composed largely of methane, with lesser amounts of ethane, propane, and butane.
- **Methane** in the atmosphere comes from both natural and manmade sources.
- **Petroleum** is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, containing 1 to 40 carbon atoms.

#### Refining of Oil

- Distilling crude petroleum (refining) separates it into fractions that differ in boiling point:
  - **Gasoline**: C$_5$H$_{12}$ – C$_{12}$H$_{26}$
  - **Kerosene**: C$_{12}$H$_{26}$ – C$_{16}$H$_{34}$
  - **Diesel fuel**: C$_{15}$H$_{32}$ – C$_{18}$H$_{36}$

#### Properties of Alkanes

- Alkanes contain only **nonpolar** C—C and C—H bonds.
  - They only exhibit **weak van der Waals forces**.
  - This affects **solubility**, **boiling points**, and **melting points** of alkanes.
  
- **Solubility of alkanes**:
  - Alkanes are more soluble in **organic solvents**.
  - Alkanes are **insoluble in water**.

### Boiling and melting points of alkanes

Alkanes have low bp’s and mp’s compared to more polar compounds of comparable size. Bp and mp increase as the number of carbons increases due to increased surface area.

<p align="center">
    <img src="./assets/alkanes-bp-mp.png" width=600 />
</p>

The bp of isomers decreases with branching due to decreased surface area, while Mp increases with increased symmetry.
