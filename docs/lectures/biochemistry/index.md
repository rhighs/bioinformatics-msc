## Biochemistry Overview
- **Topics to Understand**:
  - The basic structure and general functions of the four principal biological (macro)molecules: lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and proteins.
  - Enzymes: What are they, how do they work, and how are they regulated?
  - How biological molecules interact: What types of interactions?
  - How molecules are synthesized and degraded within cells (metabolism).
  - How energy is conserved and used within cells (metabolism).
